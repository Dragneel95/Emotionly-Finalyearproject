" S&P, as expected, did not upgrade India from BBB-, but at the same time forecast a robust economic growth over the next two years. S&P and Moody's are on the same page but different ratings on India. Here's what happened and why It was a shot in the arm for Prime Minister Narendra Modi when after 14 years Moodys upgraded Indias credit rating to Baa2 from the lowest investment grade of Baa3. But its timing was not only questioned but called premature, with analysts speculating that the other two S&P and Fitch of the Big Three credit rating agencies will not follow the suit. S&P, as expected, did not upgrade India from BBB-, but at the same time forecast a robust economic growth over the next two years. A reversal in low oil prices have raised risks to the economys fiscal, inflation and current account dynamics. We dont think the other two global rating agencies Fitch and S&P will follow-up in a hurry, based on their cautious rhetoric, mainly drawing attention to the weak fiscal (state and central government), DBS Group had said in a note last week after Moodys upgrade. Moodys justified its upgrade by saying that even as some reforms remain at the design stage, those implemented to date will support Indias strong growth potential and help improve global competitiveness to enhance the economys shock absorption capacity. S&P, too, welcomed recent actions such as the GST and Bank recapitalisation. The reading of both Moodys and S&P come on the same page that the Narendra Modi government is capable of taking tough decisions, which have had short-term disruptions but is going to have long-term benefits. Moodys, anticipating the long-term benefits, upgraded Indias rating, S&P chose the wait and watch policy which is exactly what analysts have saying given the botched demonetisation program and the imposition the GST that have left the economyespecially the lowest rungswrithing. Interestingly, S&P did not show much apprehension about the rising crude oil prices, but rather lauded India for maintaining record foreign exchange reserves to cover for international shocks. Niether did Moodys, who said, that the rise in Foreign Direct Investment and Forex, Indias external vulnerability is expected to be low. Low income and fiscal slippage were the concerns raised by both. India has long frowned at the rating agencies for not upgrading the country, and rather favouring China. India has also long lobbied for a rating upgrade, which hasnt nudged S&P yet. On this glass half-full and half-empty situation, the Finance Ministrys reaction is worth noting. Finance Minister Arun Jaitley welcomed Moodys upgrade saying, it was a belated recognition of positive steps taken by the government, while on S&P rating the Finance Ministry said, it was cautious. Historically, S&P has maintained a conservative approach to rating upgrade as compared to Moodys, this is the defence of the government, but with S&P keeping on hold Indias rating, analysts stand vindicated. Nomura had said that Moodys rating upgrade was a welcome surprise but their bias was that the rating agency will likely wait for the governments fiscal position to actually improve before making any changes. Now all eyes are on Fitch Ratings, which also currently rates India at BBB-minus with a stable outlook, in line with S&Ps ratings.

" World stock markets advanced for a seventh straight session and the dollar strengthened on Friday, buoyed by a round of U.S. economic data highlighted by the monthly payrolls report. Wall Street also received a boost from a 2.61 percent gain in shares of Apple Inc, a day after the iPhone maker reported quarterly results. U.S. job growth accelerated in October after hurricane-related disruptions in the prior month, but a sharp slowdown in annual wage gains and surge in the number of people dropping out of the work force cast a cloud over the labor market. ""If there's one thing I would focus on is the fact you're really not seeing the wage inflation. I don't necessarily think this is enough to change the calculus for the Fed in December, but people will clearly be watching next month's report,"" said Heidi Learner, chief economist at Savills Studley, Savills Plc, New York. ""The wage numbers are becoming increasingly more important than the monthly payrolls number itself."" Traders see a 90.2 percent chance of a rate hike at the central bank's next meeting, according to Thomson Reuters data. Apple gave the biggest boost to each of the major Wall Street indexes after its stronger-than-expected results on Thursday offered a rosy forecast for the holiday shopping season. Long, snaking lines formed outside the company's stores in Asia and Europe on Friday as fans flocked to buy the new iPhone X, and the U.S. company, the largest by market capitalization, moved closer to a $1 trillion valuation. With 406 of S&P 500 companies having reported earnings, 72.4 percent have topped Wall Street expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data, in line with the 72 percent average over the past four quarters. The current growth estimate for the quarter stands at 8 percent. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 22.96 points, or 0.1 percent, to 23,539.22, the S&P 500 gained 7.99 points, or 0.31 percent, to 2,587.84 and the Nasdaq Composite added 49.49 points, or 0.74 percent, to 6,764.44. For the week, the Dow rose 0.45 percent, the S&P gained 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq climbed 0.94 percent. The Dow and S&P have risen for eight straight weeks and the Nasdaq has climbed six weeks in a row. European shares closed higher on firmer tech stocks and carmakers, though gains were limited as earnings weighed on shares of French bank Societe Generale and Dutch telecoms company Altice.

" Former Yahoo Chief Executive Marissa Mayer apologised on Wednesday for two massive data breaches at the internet company, blaming Russian agents for at least one of them, at a hearing on the growing number of cyber attacks on major U.S. companies. ""As CEO, these thefts occurred during my tenure, and I want to sincerely apologise to each and every one of our users,"" she told the Senate Commerce Committee, testifying alongside the interim and former CEOs of Equifax Inc and a senior Verizon Communications Inc executive. ""Unfortunately, while all our measures helped Yahoo successfully defend against the barrage of attacks by both private and state-sponsored hackers, Russian agents intruded on our systems and stole our users' data."" Verizon, the largest U.S. wireless operator, acquired most of Yahoo Inc's assets in June, the same month Mayer stepped down. Verizon disclosed last month that a 2013 Yahoo data breach affected all 3 billion of its accounts, compared with an estimate of more than 1 billion disclosed in December. In March, federal prosecutors charged two Russian intelligence agents and two hackers with masterminding a 2014 theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts, the first time the U.S. government has criminally charged Russian spies for cyber crimes. Those charges came amid controversy relating to alleged Kremlin-backed hacking of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and possible links between Russian figures and associates of President Donald Trump. Russia has denied trying to influence the U.S. election in any way. Special Agent Jack Bennett of the FBI's San Francisco Division said in March the 2013 breach was unrelated and that an investigation of the larger incident was continuing. Mayer later said under questioning that she did not know if Russians were responsible for the 2013 breach, but earlier spoke of state-sponsored attacks. Senator John Thune, a Republican who chairs the Commerce Committee, asked Mayer on Wednesday why it took three years to identify the data breach or properly gauge its size. Mayer said Yahoo has not been able to identify how the 2013 intrusion occurred and that the company did not learn of the incident until the U.S. government presented data to Yahoo in November 2016. She said even ""robust"" defences are not enough to defend against state-sponsored attacks and compared the fight with hackers to an ""arms race."" Yahoo required users to change passwords and took new steps to make data more secure, Mayer said. ""We now know that Russian intelligence officers and state-sponsored hackers were responsible for highly complex and sophisticated attacks on Yahoo's systems,"" Mayer said. She said ""really aggressive"" pursuit of hackers was needed to discourage the efforts, and that even the most well-defended companies ""could fall victim to these crimes."" The current and former chief executives of credit bureau Equifax, which disclosed in September that a data breach affected as many as 145.5 million U.S. consumers, said they did not know who was responsible for the attack. Senator Bill Nelson said ""only stiffer enforcement and stringent penalties will help incentivize companies to properly safeguard consumer information."" Thune told reporters after the hearing the Equifax data breach had created ""additional momentum"" for Congress to approve legislation. He said Mayer's testimony was ""important in shaping our future reactions."" The Senate Commerce Committee took the unusual step of subpoenaing Mayer to testify on Oct. 25 after a representative for Mayer declined multiple requests for her voluntarily testimony. A representative for Mayer said on Tuesday she was appearing voluntarily.

" MANCHESTER: Zlatan Ibrahimovic is in contention to make his first Manchester United start in seven months this Saturday after completing his comeback from a career-threatening knee injury. The striker enjoyed an impressive first season at Old Trafford following his free transfer from Paris Saint-Germain in July 2016, only for it to be cut short by cruciate knee ligament damage sustained in a Europa League quarter-final victory over Anderlecht in April. Both Ibrahimovic and defender Marcos Rojo, who suffered a similar injury in the same match, have now fully recovered from their injuries and could play a key role as United host Brighton in the Premier League this weekend. Former Sweden international Ibrahimovic, 36, has appeared as a substitute in each of United's past two matches, coming on as Newcastle were beaten 4-1 at Old Trafford last Saturday, and again on Wednesday in a 1-0 Champions League defeat by Basel in Switzerland. Rojo made his comeback by featuring at centre-back against Basel and is likely to be asked to play there again on Saturday as Phil Jones has a thigh injury and fellow defender Eric Bailly is struggling to recover from a knock. ""I think Marcos could have been playing a couple of weeks ago,"" said United manager Mourinho. ""We didn't need to rush him, push him into that situation, but he has been training with the team for quite a long time. ""We need him with no Jones. We need Marcos back to give us the stability."" Despite those defensive concerns, Mourinho is close to having a full-strength squad for the first time in months, with Paul Pogba feeling his way back to full fitness following a serious hamstring problem. The France midfielder scored on his comeback against Newcastle after two months out of action, but faded after a good start against Basel. With a glut of fixtures coming up, Mourinho made seven changes to his starting line-up in Switzerland, with only Pogba, Anthony Martial, Chris Smalling and Romelu Lukaku remaining from the team that started against Newcastle. More changes are certain this weekend as the manager attempts to keep his players fresh. Brighton manager Chris Hughton is expecting the United side to be rejigged and is not ruling out Mourinho's men for the title, even though they are eight points adrift of Manchester City. ""Without being detrimental to the other teams in the top six, most people see the two Manchester teams as the strongest,"" he said. ""Both have recruited very well and have big star players. ""Ibrahimovic and certainly Pogba are a massive boost for them to have back at this stage of the season. They are both big teams and are showing that."" ""You can't go there with fear because if you do, it is inevitable what will happen,"" he said. ""You have to go there with a belief and a confidence that you can get something.""

" PARIS: Arsene Wenger's Arsenal secured top spot in Europa League Group H on Thursday despite slumping to a 1-0 defeat at Cologne, while AC Milan reached the last 32 by thrashing Austria Vienna. Frenchman Wenger made 11 changes to the team that beat Tottenham Hotspur in last weekend's north London derby, with starts handed to Olivier Giroud, Jack Wilshere and Danny Welbeck. But the Gunners succumbed to a 62nd-minute penalty from Sehrou Guirassy after the French striker tumbled to ground inside the area under a challenge from Mathieu Debuchy. Cologne, winless through 12 Bundesliga matches this season, climbed to second with one match to play, as a 0-0 draw between BATE Borisov and Red Star Belgrade in Belarus confirmed Arsenal's status as group winners. ""We've lost a game in which Cologne had one shot on goal other than the penalty,"" said Wenger. ""We were always missing that little something to get the goal. Cologne defended with spirit and for them it's turned out to be the perfect night."" Seven-time European champions Milan wrapped up first place in Group D with a 5-1 win over Austria Vienna at the San Siro. Christoph Monschein put the visitors ahead in Italy, but Vincenzo Montella's team roared back with Andre Silva and Patrick Cutrone both netting twice along with a goal from Ricardo Rodriguez. Atalanta sealed their spot in the knockout phase as Bryan Cristante and Andreas Cornelius notched two goals apiece to thump a listless Everton 5-1 at Goodison Park. Robin Gosens added another with a terrific dipping volley, with Sandro Ramirez scoring his first Everton goal as the Toffees crashed to a fourth defeat in five group outings. ""There was nothing riding on the game, but it's our pride. It's not nice to lose games. It's very disappointing and upsetting,"" Everton captain Wayne Rooney told BT Sport. Nabil Fekir notched his 13th goal of the season for Lyon in a 4-0 rout of Cypriots Apollon Limassol as the French side joined Atalanta in advancing from Group E. Mario Balotelli scored twice as Nice moved into the last 32 following a 3-1 victory over Zulte Waregem of Belgium, with Lazio dropping their first points in Group K after a 1-1 draw at home to Vitesse Arnhem. Marseille snatched a 93rd-minute equaliser courtesy of an own goal from Wilfried Moke in a 1-1 draw at Konyaspor to stay ahead of their Turkish opponents in the race for second behind Salzburg, 3-0 winners over Vitoria Guimaraes, in Group I. ""Miracles don't happen by chance,"" said Marseille coach Rudi Garcia, whose side saw Jordan Amavi dismissed 10 minutes from time. ""Like in the last match, the team believed in itself until the end despite being a man down."" Villarreal progressed to the knockout stages as Democratic Republic of Congo striker Cedric Bakambu netted a brace to seal a 3-2 victory over Astana in Kazakhstan. Surprise Swedish side Ostersund -- coached by Englishman Graham Potter -- extended their run in Europe into the New Year with a 2-0 home win over Ukrainians Zorya Luhansk. Veteran Spain striker Aritz Aduriz scored two penalties in Athletic Bilbao's 3-2 win over Hertha Berlin to leave the Basque club with their fate in their own hands heading into the final round of fixtures.

" NEW YORK: Undefeated champion Deontay Wilder knocked out Bermane Stiverne in devastating fashion with one second left in the opening round to retain his WBC heavyweight championship on Saturday night. The 32-year-old Wilder delivered an explosive performance as he floored Stiverne two times in the opening round before finishing it off with a punishing right-left to the head as the defenceless challenger was pinned against the ropes. Stiverne, of Canada, then slumped to the canvas and stayed motionless for some time before being helped up and into a chair where he was examined by the ring doctor at the Barclays Center arena in New York. ""I know I am the best. I just want to prove that I am the best,"" said Wilder. Wilder was the heavy favourite going into the fight as he improved to 39-0 with 38 knockouts in the sixth defence of his title. It was his second win over the 39-year-old Stiverne who came into the rematch 15 pounds heavier and had fought just once since losing to Wilder in January 2015. Wilder hopes this win will land him a super fight with Anthony Joshua in a heavyweight showdown the boxing world is dying to see. British star Joshua is the reigning IBF and WBA heavyweight champ. On the undercard, Kazakhstan's Sergey Lipinets claimed the vacant IBF junior welterweight title with a unanimous decision victory over Akihiro Kondo of Japan. Lipinets improved to 13-0 with 10 KOs as he won on all three judges' scorecards, 118-110, 117-111 and 117-111. Kondo, the third ranked challenger with a career record of 29-6-1 coming into the bout, was fighting for his first world title in his debut fight on American soil.

" GUWAHATI: There was no stopping the Indian juggernaut at the AIBA Youth women's World Boxing Championships as three of home pugilists entered the finals on Friday. Jyoti Gulia (51kg), Shashi Chopra (57kg) and Ankushita Boro (64kg) claimed contrasting victories to enter the summit clashes of their respective weight categories in front of a packed arena. However, in the +81kg category, Neha Yadav, who had got direct entry into the semifinals due to the small size of the draw, was outpunched by Kazakhstan's Dina Islambekova, ending the Indian's campaign with a bronze medal. Jyoti opened the proceedings for the home contingent and defeated Kazakhstan's Zhansaya Abdraimova. In a draining slugfest, Jyoti emerged triumphant in a split verdict. The Indian stood out for her sheer tenacity against Abdraimova, who was unrelenting with her attacks but struggled to connect due to Jyoti's shell guard. Jyoti will be up against Russia's very impressive Ekaterina Molchanova in the final. Molchanova sailed past Japan's Rinka Kinoshita. Next up was Shashi against Mongolia's Namun Monkhor in a bout that was fought on defensive tactics. The first three minutes were spent getting a measure of each other before Shashi decided to go on the offensive in the second round. The dividends were instant for her as Monkhor faced a standing eight count. Monkhor too upped the ante in the final round but Shashi took advantage of her longer reach to connect some clean straights and fetch a unanimous verdict. Shashi will face Vietnam's Do Hong Ngoc in the final on Sunday. Walking in to the loudest cheer was local favourite was Ankushita Boro (64kg) against Thailand's Thanchnok Saksri. Boro did not have an easy opponent in Saksri, who was quick to exploit the defensive lapses committed by the Indian in the opening three minutes. But Boro raised the intensity in the second and third round to swing the contest in her favour and enter the summit clash.

" The International Monetary Fund issued a warning to Venezuela on Friday for failing to provide the institution with economic data on time and gave it six months to address the lack of some statistics. The decision was not unanimous with Russia objecting to the move and others abstaining, according to two sources familiar with the IMF board discussion. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that if the Venezuela did not improve the flow of data, the IMF could issue a ""declaration of censure"" under Article 8 of the fund's rules on furnishing of information. An IMF statement said Venezuela was late on data related to the operations of the social security institute, and total exports and imports of merchandise. The data is used as part of the IMF's monitoring of economies around the world. The IMF complained last month that projecting an economic outlook for Venezuela was complicated by long gaps in receiving data from the government and data was often incomplete. The IMF finding, although unrelated to an announcement on Thursday by Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro that he wants to restructure the country's foreign debt, comes as investors worry the government is on the verge of a default. The country is locked in a bruising economic crisis that has sparked a wave of protests against Maduro's government amid calls by the international community for political mediation. Maduro on Thursday vowed to make a $1.1. billion payment on a maturing bond but also created a commission to study the restructuring of payments. The cash-strapped government invited bondholders to a Nov. 13 meeting in Caracas, although some have indicated they were first waiting to see whether the South American OPEC nation makes the $1.1. billion payment and another due next week. Venezuela, which was a founding member of the fund in 1946, remains a voting member of the IMF, but it has not had any formal engagement with the international institution for more than a decade. The IMF conducted its last economic review of Venezuela's economy in 2004. The IMF said it was ""hopeful"" that its decision will encourage Venezuela to re-engage with the IMF by making the data available.

Apple announced plans in February 2015 to build the facility in a rural location in the west of Ireland to take advantage of green energy sources nearby, but the project has faced a two-year delay due to planning objections. In a meeting on Thursday, Cook did not commit to going ahead with it, Varadkar told state broadcaster RTE. ""We didn't get a start date, or a definite commitment or anything like that,"" said Varadkar, who is on a tour of the United States to meet investors, adding he had told Cook that the government would do ""anything within our power"" to facilitate the resumption of the project. Ireland relies on foreign multinational companies like Apple for the creation of one in every 10 jobs across the economy and sees major investments such as data centres as a means of securing their presence in the country. Apple did not respond to an e-mail query asking about whether it was committed to the project. A similar Apple centre announced at the same time in Denmark is due to begin operations later this year and Apple in July announced it would build its second EU data centre there. The government has said it is considering amending its planning laws to include data centres as strategic infrastructure, thus allowing them to get through the planning process much more quickly.

" The euro slipped on Tuesday but stayed within recent trading ranges, as recent economic data surpassed market expectations, making investors wary of pushing the single currency lower. Investor sentiment towards Germany climbed to a record high, Monday's data showed, as the euro zone's largest economy fueled a brisk economic recovery in the region, and region-wide growth was robust in October, according to a survey. ""While risky assets have been robust, currency markets have been generally sidelined as there are very little event risks on the horizon and until we see a big surprise in economic data, currency markets will be trapped in tight ranges,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, a FX strategist at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt. The euro edged 0.2 percent lower to $1.1591 in early trades. Trading ranges in the single currency have become narrower since the European Central Bank said on Oct. 26 it was cutting back its monthly bond purchases, with the euro remaining in a half percent daily trading range against the dollar. However, in the general risk-on environment emerging-market currencies saw some flows as carry trades regained favour. The Brazilian real rose 2 percent on Monday, its biggest-single-day rise in nearly six months, and the Indonesia rupiah pushed higher. The dollar index gained against a basket of six major currencies to 94.913, nearing a 10-day peak of 95.077 reached on Monday. The dollar had been solid after strong U.S. services and factory data released before the weekend backed expectations that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month and tighten further in 2018. Australia's central bank on Tuesday left its cash rate at a record-low 1.5 percent, and it looked likely to remain sidelined for months, with inflation low and debt-laden consumers cautious .

" PUNE: The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing, Pune, has inked a pact with the National Investigation Agency for developing a state-of-the-art data centre for the latter. The Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune, will provide data and network security for the agency's new headquarters in New Delhi. With the number of crimes via the internet increasing, C-DAC will also develop advanced cyber forensics capability for National Investigation Agency (NIA), the centre's executive director, Hemant Darbari, told TOI. Inspector-general Mukesh Singh of NIA and Darbari signed the two-year memorandum of understanding (MoU) on November 3 in Delhi. ""The MoU is intended to establish a collaboration between the C-DAC and NIA for consultancy/ turnkey solutions in designing and implementing the information systems architecture, data centre and other related information systems projects of critical importance to the agency and its branches. In the past, NIA, Kochi, consulted C-DAC, Thiruvanathapuram, for the capacity building of its IT division and cyber forensics,"" NIA's official notification stated. The agency's new headquarters is in New Delhi, where C-DAC is building a modern data centre. ""They need data analytics and cyber security labs among other facilities, which we will be providing,"" said Darbari. Cyber forensics involves retrieving and analysing data from gadgets (such as computers, cellphones) used to commit a cyber crime. ""With more and more cyber crimes reported on a daily basis, cyber forensics is the need of the hour,"" said Darbari. Network security to avoid any data breach or intrusion from foreign or unscrupulous elements is also of prime importance for the country. This means that indigenous institutions develop tools to ensure that NIA's confidential data is protected. ""With foreign products, we don't know what will happen, especially when it comes to data security. In layman's terms, we are developing encryption and protection tools so that the data is not open to intrusion at any stage of storage or transmission,"" Darbari said. Some of the projects C-DAC has undertaken for INA include a robust network of IT architecture and security as well as hardware optimization. By monitoring various networking sites and other movement on the internet, C-DAC claims it will be able to predict the occurrence of a crime and prevent it. ""As a part of the project's second phase, we will be working on prediction of crime,"" Darbari added.

" LONDON: A top British plastic surgery clinic, known to have high-profile clients, said it is ""horrified"" after hackers allegedly stole terabytes of data during a recent cyber-attack. London Bridge Plastic Surgery (LBPS) said its IT experts and police found evidence of the breach. A group claiming to be behind the breach said it had ""terabytes"" of data, the Daily Beast news site reported. The Metropolitan Police is investigating the attack, the BBC reported. The alleged hackers, using the pseudonym The Dark Overlord, said they had obtained photos showing various body parts of clients, including genitals. Some of these images have been sent to the Daily Beast. The hackers also claimed that the data contained information on ""royal families"" and added that they planned to distribute the patient list and corresponding photos online. ""We are still working to establish exactly what data has been compromised,"" LBPS said in a statement. ""We are horrified that they have now targeted our patients."" A spokeswoman for the Metropolitan Police said it was notified of a suspected breach on October 17. She added that there had been no arrests and that inquiries by the Organised Crime Command were continuing. The LBPS is known to have high-profile clients, including model and TV presenter Katie Price, who recently used her Instagram account to thank the clinic for her facelift. The Information Commissioner's Office said, ""We are aware of this incident and are looking into the details. ""All organisations are required under data protection law to keep people's personal data safe and secure."" The Dark Overlord has claimed to be behind high-profile data breaches before, including one at US media firm Netflix earlier this year. In April, 10 episodes of the new series of TV show Orange is the New Black were released online after Netflix refused to pay a ransom.

" The dollar drifted sideways on Friday after a week of losses, as markets waited for U.S. jobs data to shake the currency out of recent ranges, with some market analysts saying the currency may have peaked for now. The Australian dollar was the big loser of the day, falling half a percent after disappointing retail sales data. The British pound dropped to a one-month low after plunging on Thursday. The market showed little reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump's appointment on Thursday of Jerome Powell, a Fed governor, to lead the U.S. central bank. That broke with precedent by denying incumbent Janet Yellen a second term but signalled a continuation of her cautious monetary policies . ""I think the Powell news was not really a surprise for markets, who have been expecting this, but we think the dollar may have hit a short-term peak for now in the absence of any upside data surprises,"" said Lutz Karpowitz, an FX strategist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. The next big data release comes later today. The U.S. non-farm payrolls report is expected to show job numbers bounced back in October after September's drop. Against a broad basket of currencies, the dollar edged 0.1 percent higher to 94.817, up from a one-week low of 94.411 set on Thursday. The Australian dollar slipped half a percent to $0.7651 , coming under pressure after data showed that retail sales were flat in September. That was below market expectations for a rise of 0.4 percent on the month. Sterling continued to fall after suffering its biggest one-day fall against the dollar since June on Thursday, when the Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade but said it sees only gradual rises ahead. Sterling fell 0.2 percent to $1.3040, its lowest since Oct. 6, after losing 1.4 percent on Thursday. Morgan Stanley strategists said the prospect of more U.S. rate increases next year would put pressure on currencies such as the Australian dollar and sterling, since households in those countries have racked up large debts in recent years. ""As the Fed continues to raise interest rates, these funding costs will rise, if not compensated by lower borrowing costs in their home currency,"" Morgan Stanley strategists said in a note.

" Mumbai, Nov 3 () It was another day of records for stocks today as benchmarks Sensex and Nifty crossed new milestones, riding on positive PMI data and more capital inflows. Services sector activity in India expanded for the second consecutive month in October, driven up by rising new orders -- the fastest pace since June -- amid positive demand conditions, according to a monthly PMI (Purchasing Managers' Index) survey. Global leads turned for the better after appointment of Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell as the new chief of the US central bank and the unveiling of tax reforms by House Republicans in Washington. Earnings optimism among investors grew, too. The 30-share BSE index firmed up to an all-time intra-day high of 33,733.71 on a flurry of buying before closing at a record 33,685.56, up 112.34 points, or 0.33 per cent.

" Wall Street was poised to open higher on Friday after robust October jobs data report added to upbeat investor sentiment following Apple's blowout results and strong initial demand for the company's new iPhone X. The Labor Department's closely watched employment report showed U.S. job growth rebounded in October after hurricane-related disruptions hurt employment in September. Nonfarm payrolls rose by 261,000 jobs last month, according to the report. That was the largest gain since July 2016, but was below economists' expectations for an increase of 310,000 jobs. The unemployment rate fell to 4.1 percent from 4.2 percent and average hourly earnings were largely unchanged. However, the data hinted at slowing labor market momentum as annual wage gains sharply retreated. However, the data did little to move the case for an interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve in December. ""The headline is all noise, you are starting to adjust for the hurricanes and it's really hard to know exactly what's going to happen,"" said Subadra Rajappa, head of U.S. rates strategy at Societe Generale in New York. ""I thought the number overall was good."" At 8:42 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 38 points, or 0.16 percent, with 19,723 contracts changing hands. S&P 500 e-minis were up 2.5 points, or 0.1 percent, with 110,705 contracts traded. Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 31.75 points, or 0.51 percent, on volume of 28,755 contracts. Apple surged 3.68 percent to $174.3 in premarket trading after reporting upbeat results and strong initial demand for the new iPhone X. At current levels, Apple was on pace to become the first company to breach $900 billion in market capitalization. With more than three-fourths of the S&P 500 companies having reported, 72.7 percent have topped profit estimates, led by technology companies. President Donald Trump on Thursday tapped Fed Governor Jerome Powell to become head of the U.S. central bank, in a largely anticipated move, signaling a continuation of current chair Janet Yellen's monetary policies. In Washington, House Republicans also disclosed their long-delayed plans for tax cuts on Thursday. However, the market reacted with skepticism, as many investors believe it is just a starting point with significant negotiations likely ahead. AIG fell 3.62 percent after the insurer posted a bigger loss on huge catastrophe losses and said it set aside more in reserves.

" Nvidia Corp's quarterly profit and revenue topped market estimates and the chipmaker also gave a strong revenue forecast for the current quarter, powered by demand for its graphics chips used in gaming and data centers. The company's shares were up 2.5 percent in extended trading on Thursday. Their roughly 92-percent surge this year has made them the third-best performing stock on the Philadelphia Semiconductor index. The strength in Nvidia's data center in the third quarter comes after a disappointing showing in the previous quarter and on the heels of rival Intel Corp showcasing its strength in the same market two weeks back. Nvidia gets the bulk of its revenue from gaming, for which it is best known. But its growth hinges on new areas, especially its data center business, where its customers include Amazon.com Inc's Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp's Azure. Revenue from the business, Nvidia's second-biggest revenue contributor, more than doubled to $501 million in the quarter and easily beat analysts' estimate of $474.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. ""We've been steadfast with the excitement of accelerated computing for data centers. And I think this is just the beginning of it all,"" Chief Executive Jensen Huang said on an analyst call. Nvidia's gaming revenue increased 25.5 percent to $1.56 billion, accounting for nearly 60 percent of total revenue. That also beat analysts average estimate of $1.31 billion. ""Gaming is one of the fastest-growing entertainment industries and we're well-positioned for the holidays,"" Huang said. Huang also played down a recent announcement by bitter rivals Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Intel to partner to take on Nvidia in graphic chips for PCs. AUTOMOTIVE NOT YET RELEVANT Nvidia has also expanded its reach in automobiles, from making chips for infotainment systems, to unveiling its first chip for self-driving cars in October. Another source of demand has been from increasing interest in cryptocurrency mining. But Huang sought to temper expectations of a drive from that demand, echoing his own remarks and those from rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc two weeks back. ""The longer-term way to think about that is crypto is small for us but not zero. And I believe that crypto will be around for sometime, kind of like today,"" Huang said. Revenue from Nvidia's automotive business rose 13.3 percent to $144 million, falling shy of estimates of $149.8 million. But analysts were not worried. ""While automotive is an important long-term growth driver for NVDA, investors' near-term focus is on the growth metrics of gaming and data center end-markets,"" Loop Capital Markets analyst Betsy Van Hees said in an e-mail. Nvidia's total revenue rose 31.5 percent to $2.64 billion, and profit surged 54.6 percent to $838 million, or $1.33 per share, in the quarter ended Oct. 29. Analysts' on average were expecting a profit of 94 cents per share on revenue of $2.36 billion. The company forecast fourth-quarter revenue of $2.65 billion, plus or minus 2 percent, which translates to a range of $2.60 billion to $2.70 billion. Analysts were expecting $2.44 billion.

" CHENNAI: Tamil Nadu health minister C Vijay Baskar on Friday launched a mobile app to record road accidents in the state. The app, developed by IIT-Madras, will capture real-time data from all government hospitals in the state. As a pilot, the app has collected information in trauma and postmortem impressions from five hospitals. ""Our aim is to reduce the number deaths due to the accident and also find out how such accidents can be prevented,"" said Vijay Baskar while launching the app at a conference at IIT-Madras. The target of Sustained Development Goal (SDG) is to halve the number of global deaths and injuries from road traffic accidents by 2023. ""To achieve this, it is essential to ensure timely referral and definitive treatment for the injured victims within the golden hour,"" the minister said. The app will be used to study six major categories -- road accidents, fall injuries, assault cases, surgeries, head injuries and mode of patient transfer. It would be extended to all the government hospitals under the programme, said Venkatesh Balasubramanian of the department of engineering design at the IIT-Madras. ""While the aim is to increase the survival rate of the injured people, we will be able to do research on the reasons for the cause of trauma with the type of injuries. This will also help us prevent accidents,"" he said. Australia-India Trauma System The 182-year old Madras Medical College will be part of the Australia-India Trauma System (AITSC), which brings together the two governments, industry, clinicians and researchers to improve information and resources and pilot new systems of emergency care. The state initiative is being led by the Tamil Nadu Accident and Emergency Care Initiative (TAEI), a new wing formed under the state health department to bring down fatalities in road traffic accident. The TAEI was formed after the state had been continuously topped the country in the number of road accidents and fatalities. The TAEI, in co-ordination with the IIT-Madras and the National Trauma Research Institute (Australia), organised the two-day conference at the IIT-M to discuss various issues including kinds of road accidents, the available pre-hospitalisation facilities, number of trauma care centres and facilities besides research on trauma. ""We aim at bringing the best practices to Tamil Nadu. AITSC is led by AIIMS in New Delhi,"" said the health minister.

Indrani submitted an application before the trial court on Wednesday seeking Peter's call data records from an alternate number alleging that he along with others had conspired, abducted and caused Sheena's disappearance. Indrani said that Sheena might have lost her life on account of greed, betrayal, jealousy, lust and ill will of persons whom she dearly loved and trusted. The court said that the copy of the plea was to be given to Peter and the CBI. Currently, the second witness, driver Shyamvar Rai is being cross examined by the defence. Rai has been on the stand since July. Sheena Bora, 24, was abducted and murdered on April 24, 2012 allegedly by her mother Indrani, Indrani's ex-husband Sanjiv Khanna, driver Shyamvar Rai in conspiracy with Indrani's husband Peter Mukerjea. Sheena's body was disposed off on April 25, 2015 at a deserted spot off Pen-Khopoli road, Raigad. Rai was arrested on August 21, 2015, by the Khar police in an illegal arms case. During interrogation, he told them about Sheena's murder after Indrani and Khanna were arrested. On September 29, 2015 the case was transferred to the CBI.

" NEW DELHI: Congress party alleged on Thursday that empirical data available from open source and government platforms contradicted the claims made by Delhi government on the good health of the capital's school education. Taking on three official claims about enhanced infrastructure for schools, highest budgetary allocation to education and an increase in students from the government schools clearing the Class XII board exams after Aam Aadmi Party took over the government in 2015, Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee president Ajay Maken alleged that this was all propaganda and that ""since independence this is the first time that the number of students in government schools have decreased despite an annual population growth of 2.42% in Delhi"". Responding to the allegations, the state government insisted that education was still a work in progress that had to ""recover from the damage done by 15 years of Congress rule"". Deriding the figures toted out by the government to show how education and infrastructure were on the mend in Delhi, the Delhi Congress chief claimed, ""If 5,000 new classrooms have been created, this means if we assume approximately 40 students per classroom an additional capacity of two lakh students in Delhi's government schools. But the number of students in government schools after a continuous increase till 2013-14, when our government was in place, has declined to 16.77 lakh. This is despite the annual 2.42% point population growth in Delhi."" At a special presentation to the media, Maken sought to underline the statistical drop in students with the numbers in private schools, where, he said, the student strength had gone up ""significantly"" in the same period. ""So if the AAP government is claiming that the government schools have seen qualitative improvement, then why are students fleeing to private schools? Is there a sudden increase in household incomes or has there been a gradual decline in the government school system in the last three years?"" Maken asked. He also attacked the government for letting grants lapse and alleged that the government simply flashed advertisements about the ""biggest sum to education"" at public expense. Maken pointed at figures showing that 13.55% in 20 15-16 and 11.5% in 2016-17 of the budgetary allocation on education had gone unspent. Calculating such unspent funds at Rs 1,982 crore, Maken showed the then Congress government ""overspending"" on education in the four years prior to 2012-13. Maken also claimed that the government was making false claims about government students performing better in the board exams. The Congress leader said that the gap between the number of students passing the Class XII exam from government and private schools had actually narrowed from 19.16% point in 2009 to 8.29% point in 2017. Reacting to the charges, Atishi Marlena, senior advisor to Deputy CM Manish Sisodia, who is also education minister, retorted in a statement: ""Those who destroyed Delhi's government school system, left buildings in dilapidated state and were hand-in-glove with private schools should themselves be answering these questions. We are still in the process of making government schools recover from the damage done by 15 years of Congress rule.""

" SAN FRANCISCO: Uber is coming clean about its cover-up of a year-old hacking attack that stole personal information about more than 57 million of the beleaguered ride-hailing service's customers and drivers. So far, there's no evidence that the data taken has been misused, according to a Tuesday blog post by Uber's recently hired CEO, Dara Khosrowshahi. Part of the reason nothing malicious has happened is because Uber acknowledges paying the hackers $100,000 to destroy the stolen information. The revelation marks the latest stain on Uber's reputation. The San Francisco company ousted Travis Kalanick as CEO in June after an internal investigation concluded he had built a culture that allowed female workers to be sexually harassed and encouraged employees to push legal limits. It's also the latest major breach involving a prominent company that didn't notify the people that could be potentially harmed for months or even years after the break-in occurred. Yahoo didn't make its first disclosure about hacks that hit 3 billion user accounts during 2013 and 2014 until September 2016. Credit reporting service Equifax waited several months before revealing this past September that hackers had carted off the Social Security numbers of 145 million Americans. Khosrowshahi criticized Uber's handling of its data theft in his blog post. ""While I can't erase the past, I can commit on behalf of every Uber employee that we will learn from our mistakes,"" Khosrowshahi wrote. ""We are changing the way we do business, putting integrity at the core of every decision we make and working hard to earn the trust of our customers."" That pledge shouldn't excuse Uber's previous regime for its egregious behavior, said Sam Curry, chief security officer for the computer security firm Cybereason. ""The truly scary thing here is that Uber paid a bribe, essentially a ransom to make this breach go away, and they acted as if they were above the law,"" Curry said. ""Those people responsible for the integrity and confidentiality of the data in-fact covered it up."" The heist took the names, email addresses and mobile phone numbers of 57 million riders around the world. The thieves also nabbed the driver's license numbers of 600,000 Uber drivers in the U.S. Uber waited until Tuesday to begin notifying the drivers with compromised driver's licenses, which can be particularly useful for perpetrating identify theft. For that reason, Uber will now pay for free credit-report monitoring and identity theft protection services for the affected drivers. Kalanick, who still sits on Uber's board of directors, declined to comment on the data breach that took place in October 2016. Uber says the response to the hack was handled by its chief security officer, Joe Sullivan, a former federal prosecutor whom Kalanick lured away from Facebook in 2015. As part of his effort to set things right, Khosrowshahi extracted Sullivan's resignation from Uber and also jettisoned Craig Clark, a lawyer who reported to Sullivan. Clark didn't immediately respond to a request for comment sent through his LinkedIn profile. Efforts to reach Sullivan were unsuccessful. Uber's silence about its breach came while it was negotiating with the Federal Trade Commission about its handling of its riders' information. Earlier in 2016, the company reached a settlement with the New York attorney general requiring it to take steps to be more vigilant about protecting the information that its app stores about its riders. As part of that settlement, Uber also paid a $20,000 fine for waiting to notify five months about another data breach that it discovered in September 2014.

" WASHINGTON: Making a mockery of US President Trump's warnings that US forces are 'locked and loaded' and would inflict unprecedented 'fire and fury' if it continued its provocations, North Korea's isolated communist regime on Sunday defiantly tested a massive nuclear device that it claimed was a thermonuclear weapon, otherwise known as a Hydrogen bomb. North Korean state media said that the test was carried to test 'the accuracy and credibility' of its 'H-bomb to be placed at the payload of the Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM).' Pyongyang tested an ICBM for the first time in July this year, with a second test later that month showing it could, depending on the payload, perhaps hit mainland USA, if its claim that it had miniaturized a nuclear weapon to fit onto a missile was true. Sunday's test, preceded by the release of photographs purportedly showing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting the weapon that was exploded, blew open differences in the US-led coalition even as it caused consternation in the Far East and beyond. President Trump led the universal condemnation of the test, calling North Korea a 'rogue nation' whose 'words and actions continue to be very hostile and dangerous to the United States.' More significantly, he tweeted that 'South Korea is finding, as I have told them, that their talk of appeasement with North Korea will not work, they only understand one thing!' Implicit in the tweet was the idea that he (Trump) is ready to rain 'fire and fury' on North Korea as he had threatened when Pyongyang tested its ICBM, and that South Korea, which has long advocated a path of talks and reconciliation restrained him. With barely any distance - and time - separating South Korea and North Korea, the US ally and its capital Seoul is a sitting duck for North Korea's missiles - nuclear or otherwise - compared to the US. But on Sunday, US and South Korean officials and generals were on the hotline to coordinate a response to North Korea's test, after President Trump spoke to South Korean President from Air Force One on his way back from Texas and Louisiana where he surveyed the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey. South Korea's Yonhap news agency reported that Gen. Joseph Dunford, the US chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, phoned his South Korean counterpart Gen. Jeong Kyeong-doo to promise support and co-operation and the pair had 'agreed to discuss all military measures against the North.' It also said that Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of the US Forces Korea and the allies' Combined Forces Command, agreed shortly after the detonation to take action 'as soon as possible,' without elaborating on what it could entail.

" SEOUL: It's 3.11pm on a cold, gray day on the North Korean side of the most heavily armed border in the world, and a lone soldier is racing toward freedom. His dark olive-green jeep speeds down a straight, tree-lined road, past drab, barren fields and, headlights shining, across the replacement for the Bridge of No Return, which was used for prisoner exchanges during the Korean War. The shock of soldiers watching the jeep rush by is palpable from the video released Wednesday, and no wonder: They're beginning to realize that one of their comrades is defecting to the South. They sprint after him. The jeep slows and turns at a monument to North Korean founder Kim Il Sung, the staging point for North Korean tours of the area. The border is near, South Korea just beyond it. Four North Korean soldiers, weapons in their hands, race by the blue huts that straddle the line and are familiar to anyone who has toured the only spot on the border where North and South Korean soldiers face off within spitting distance of each other. There are no tourists this day. Right at the line that divides North from South, the defector crashes the jeep into a ditch. Seconds pass as he tries in vain to gun the vehicle out of the gully before leaping out and sprinting into the South. He kicks up leaves, ducking below a tree branch just as the North Korean soldiers skid into view. Muzzles flash. The North Korean soldiers, one of whom drops flat into the leaves, fire at the defector at close range with handguns and AK-47 assault rifles -- about 40 rounds, the South says. Suddenly, two of the North Koreans run away while the soldier in the leaves jumps up and dashes across the dividing line into South Korean territory before stopping, turning on his heels and sprinting back to the northern side after his comrades. The defector falls stretched out and unmoving in a pile of leaves against a small wall on the South Korean side. The entire sequence, from the first appearance of the jeep to the soldier's frenzied crossing, lasts four minutes. It unfolded November 13 in the Joint Security Area, which is overseen by both the American-led UN Command and North Korea and lies inside the 4-kilometre-wide Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that has been the de facto border between the Koreas since the war. Forty minutes later, the video has switched to infrared to show the heat signatures of two South Korean soldiers as they crawl on their hands and knees, using a wall as cover, toward the prone defector. They grab hold of the defector and drag him to safety. Not far away, heavily armed North Korean troops begin to gather near the Kim Il Sung monument. For the moment, the border is quiet again.

""His condition has become much better since yesterday. We've turned on the TV for him since yesterday,"" doctor Lee Cook-jong told reporters. ""He said it was so painful when he was shot by bullets but that he doesn't feel pain now,"" he said. Doctors plan to keep him at an intensive care unit for at least several more days to guard against possible infection, hospital official Shin Mi-jeong said. While treating the wounds, surgeons earlier removed dozens of parasites from the soldier's ruptured small intestine, including presumed roundworms that were as long as 27 centimetres, which may reflect poor nutrition and health in North Korea's military. The soldier is 1.7 metres (5 feet, 7 inches) tall but weighs just 60 kilograms (132 pounds). About 30,000 North Koreans have fled to South Korea, mostly across the porous border with China, since the end of the 1950-53 Korean War.

" A recent report that Yogi Aditya Nath was among top Indian leaders on the hit list of terror group Islamic State (IS) underlines the threat perception to the UP chief minister. He has long been on the hit list of militant organisations, but a murderous attack on him about a decade ago was carried out not by any terror outfit, but home-grown subversive elements in Azamagarh. The attack on his convoy+ in Azamagarh on September 7, 2008, and the inside story of how he survived, has been documented in 'Yogi Aditynath: The Rise of A Saffron Socialist' published by Times Group Books. Written by TOI journalist Pravin Kumar, the book will be formally unveiled at Times Litfest Delhi 2017 on Sunday. The book says that Yogi was on his way to address an anti-terrorism rally in Azamgarh to counter rival parties whose leaders had started making a beeline to the house of Abu Basheer, arrested for his alleged role in Ahmedabad blasts in July 2008. According to the book, ""Several saffron organisations, led by the Hindu Yuva Vahini, announced that they would hold a rally against terrorism in Azamgarh. Yogi was to be the chief speaker in the rally slated to be held at the DAV ground on 7 September 2008. On the morning of the rally, a fleet of 40 vehicles started from Gorakhnath Temple. Since it was feared that they might face hostilities in Azamgarh, Team Yogi was well prepared. In the convoy, Yogi's red SUV was the seventh in number. However, nothing had prepared them for what was going to crop up on the outskirts of Azamgarh. By the time the convoy came closer to Azamgarh, it already had a hundred fourwheelers and many more motorcycles. Besides, after intelligence inputs about the threat of an attack, a Provincial Armed Constabulary (PAC) unit was also following the fleet. But nobody knew what could be the place or form of the attack. At 1.20pm, just as the convoy was passing through the Takia, a little before Azamgarh town, a stone hit the seventh vehicle in the convoy. Soon, stones started coming from all directions. Then came petrol bombs... It was a synchronised assault, planned well in advance. Its suddenness pulverised Yogi's supporters. The fleet had been divided into three. Six vehicles had moved ahead and most of them were left far behind. But a few of them in the middle came under attack. Assailants had surrounded the vehicles and started attacking the occupants. They were hunting for their target. But he was nowhere to be found. His disappearance annoyed them and they turned fiercer. But where was Yogi? After the men in the fleet recovered their senses, everybody was asking the same question. Meanwhile, reinforcements from other police stations had reached the troubled site and vendors on either side of the street came to the rescue and formed a shield around the vehicles under attack. The city's circle officer, Shailendra Srivastava, ordered a counter offensive. One person was killed. The injured in the convoy were rushed to hospital. But there was still no trace of Yogi."" As the search for him got frantic, it was found that Yogi had moved much farther ahead and was waiting for the rest of the vehicles. He was, in fact, in the first SUV of the fleet. The change-over had been done at a PWD guesthouse when the convoy had taken a short break. The attackers in Takia, probably, did not have the information about this last-minute change. Apart from this, the book has several other unreported nuggets from Yogi's fascinating life, from the scenic Pauri in Uttarakhand to one of the most revered maths of eastern UP and then finally to the CM house in Lucknow.

It is learnt that the team management has brought to light the fact that players' privacy and security is often breached by the co-passengers in the economy class. Fans tend to encroach upon the players' space and bother them for selfies, autographs etc. There are times when the cricketers are tired after a hectic series and would look forward to a hassle-free travel which may not be possible in economy class. Some tall cricketers like Hardik Pandya, KL Rahul, Mohammad Shami and Ishant Sharma often struggle for leg-space in the economy section. Even waiting for their luggage, the cricketers are often mobbed inside the airport complex. BCCI's acting president CK Khanna had also proposed this upgrade through a letter to his BCCI colleagues to speed up the process. When TOI spoke to Khanna, he confirmed sending such a proposal. ""We should re-consider this and take a call on it,"" he said. ","Even waiting for their luggage, the cricketers are often mobbed inside the airport complex.

" AHMEDABAD: The ruling BJP has maintained a complete domination over urban seats in eight municipal corporation areas of Gujarat since 1990. While there were in all 28 such seats till 2007, post-delimitation these increased to 39 in the last elections in 2012 - when BJP won a whopping 35. The Congress won only four - two in Ahmedabad and one each in Jamnagar and Rajkot. Even in 1990, when the party contested just 143 seats out of a total of 182 seats in the assembly, the BJP won 18 seats. The Congress slide in urban Gujarat in fact began in 1990, when it bagged just four seats with seven seats going to the Janata Dal. The best performance by the Congress in the last six elections for the city vote was in 2007 when it managed six wins. The increase in seats post delimitation was due to growing urbanisation and expansion of boundaries of some of the municipal corporations - Ahmedabad, Vadodara, Surat, Rajkot, Jamnagar, Bhavnagar, Junagadh and Gandhinagar. There are reasons to believe that if the BJP wins a majority in 2017, it will be because of wins in the eight big cities of Gujarat. The BJP presently rules all eight municipal corporations. In 2015, when civic body polls were held across Gujarat, the BJP ceded ground to the Congress in the zila and taluka panchayats, as also the municipalities, but gave its best ever performance in the municipal corporations. This, despite the violent Patidar agitation for quota having begun well and truly. BJP spokesperson Yamal Vyas said, ""Our party has a strong urban presence because we had a good workers base in cities since 1990."" Congress spokesperson Manish Doshi said, ""We are raising urban issues but we need to focus more on booth management in cities. Even Rahul Gandhi has had a number of interactions with doctors, lawyers and businessmen.""

" WASHINGTON: The recent slowdown in India's economic growth+ is an ""aberration"" mainly due to the temporary disruptions in preparation for the GST, the World Bank said on Thursday, pointing out that it will get corrected in the coming months. World Bank President Jim Yong Kim also said that the Goods and Services Tax (GST) is going to have a hugely positive impact on the Indian economy. ""There's been a deceleration in the first quarter, but we think that's mostly due to temporary disruptions in preparation for the GST, which by the way is going to have a hugely positive impact on the economy,"" Kim told a group of reporters during a conference call ahead of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank here. Finance minister Arun Jaitley would be leading the Indian delegation to the annual meeting next week. Kim was responding to questions on slowdown in India's growth in the first quarter, which the opposition and several economists have attributed to demonetisation and the GST. India's GDP grew 5.7 per cent on a year-on-year basis during the April-June period (Q1). During the previous quarter (January-March) the GDP had grown by 6.1 per cent. The GDP growth rate for the same quarter last year was 7.9 per cent. Responding to questions, the World Bank president insisted that this slowdown is temporary. ""We think that the recent slowdown is an aberration which will correct in the coming months, and the GDP growth will stabilise during the year. We've been watching carefully, as Prime Minister (Narendra) Modi has really worked on improving the business environment, and so, we think all of those efforts will pay off as well,"" Kim said. Next week, both the World Bank and the IMF are expected to come out with their new GDP figures and growth projections for India and the rest of the world. ""Let me just say, as I said from the beginning. I'm not sure that I could say that any country in the world is investing enough in their human beings. I think there's no country in the world that can't improve its healthcare system. There's no country in the world that can't improve its educational system,"" Kim said. Ahead of the annual meeting, Kim said after years of disappointing growth, the global economy has begun to accelerate, and trade is picking up as well, but investment remains weak. ""We are concerned that downside risks such as a rise in protectionism, policy uncertainty, or possible financial market turbulence could derail this fragile recovery,"" he said. ""Countries need to continue to advance their reform agenda, they need to invest in people. They need to build resilience against overlapping challenges, including the effects of climate change, natural disasters, as well as conflict, forced displacement, famine and disease."" Responding to a question on India and human capital, Kim said Prime Minister Modi has made a huge commitment to sanitation issues, and 'Swachh Bharat' is one of the ""most effective programmes"" anywhere. ""I know that Prime Minister Modi himself personally is very committed to improving opportunities for all of India. But, India has a lot of challenges. We look at some of the educational outcomes, we've looked at some of the health outcomes, and India has room to improve, like most other countries,"" he said. ""Our job is to take the political will and commitment that Prime Minister Modi has clearly demonstrated and has communicated to everyone, and then bring to India the most effective intervention that will, as quickly as possible, improve the stock of human capital,"" Kim said. That's the message for every country in the world, he said. ""The Bank stands ready, with lots of new insights on how to improve health outcomes and improve education outcomes to help every country in the world with financing, with technical knowledge, and with direct support around implementation that will lead to a situation where we can talk about an emerging equality of opportunity, which has got to be the central focus of all this work,"" he said. Kim said investing in people drives economic growth. But far too many leaders undervalue the contribution of human capital which one builds through effective investments in people through health care, quality education, jobs and skills. ""Human capital is the key to reducing poverty and to reducing inequality,"" he said. This year, the Bank is producing a new report in a series on 'The Changing Wealth of Nations'. For the first time, it has added human capital to its wealth analysis, in addition to produced capital, things like machinery and buildings, natural capital, energy, forests, agricultural lands, and net foreign assets, he said.

" NEW DELHI: The government on Wednesday recommended an ordinance to significantly tighten the norms to bar promoters of companies facing insolvency proceedings from bidding for the ailing entities, in a move that will shut out several business families from vying with competitors and overseas funds. Apart from seeking to ban bidding by wilful defaulters, the Insolvency &amp; Bankruptcy Code+ will be amended to disqualify a tainted promoter in control of an entity that has been a 'non-performing asset' for a ""prescribed period"", which may be fixed at one year. A continuous loan default for 90 days forces banks to classify a borrower as an NPA. The one-year clause will make promoters of some of the 12 large companies facing insolvency action such as the Ruias of Essar Steel and Singhals of Bhushan Steel ineligible to submit financial bids for their companies next month. Bankers said both the entities were classified as NPAs in 2015. At the same time, it may help reduce competition for companies such as JSW, Tata Steel, Arcelor Mittal and Nippon Steel and comes with the risk of bids being less aggressive. The 12 companies, which account for nearly a quarter of the NPAs, were referred to the National Company Law Tribunal by banks led by State Bank of India and IDBI Bank after the Reserve Bank of India stepped in to clean up the unprecedented pile of bad debt that added up to nearly Rs 8.4 lakh crore on last count. The list includes Bhushan Power & Steel, Jaypee Infratech, Monnet Ispat, Amtek Auto and ABG Shipyard. Finance minister Arun Jaitley told reporters that the cabinet had recommended amendments but did not comment on the provisions. Details of the ordinance are expected only after President Ram Nath Kovind approves it. With the winter session+ expected to be convened on December 15, the ordinance is likely to be promulgated over the next few days. The move gains significance in the light of the straitjacket banks and government is facing due to stressed assets. The government had enacted the Insolvency & Bankruptcy Code last year, which provides for a revival plan in a maximum of 270 days. During this period, the company is handled by an NCLT-appointed resolution professional. The government opted to amend the law in less than a year as it feared that some promoters may end up acquiring the company at a steep discount, leaving banks to grapple with the pile of loans. ""A number of cases are likely to have long-pending default requiring deep haircut for the creditors. It is, therefore, necessary to ensure that promoters of the corporate debtor or the company, who are found to have contributed to the default, need to be prevented from regaining control through back door entry in the garb of a resolution applicant,"" said a source. The ordinance also gives more powers to the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India to prescribe eligibility norms for prospective bidders or resolution applicants while keeping in mind the complexity and scale of operations of business of the ailing company. Lenders as well as industry experts are closely watching how the government defines the ""prescribed period"" and its implications on the overall business environment. ""A company gets into financial stress because of various reasons such as technological obsolescence or sudden change in policies, including court pronouncements such as cancellation of coal blocks or spectrum. By barring all promoters, you may be hitting the entrepreneurship environment,"" said a top executive with a leading bank. Industry experts also said that some of the norms proposed by the government opened the doors to further litigation. For instance, a promoter can be classified as a wilful defaulter and not allowed to bid but the court overturns the lender's decision later. ""The disqualification on account of the debtor being a non performing account is harsh as there could be genuine reasons for default. Businesses succeed but also fail and a bonafide failure should not be punished. As a society we need to learn to forgive an unfortunate debtor and give him a second chance. Failure can also be as legitimate as success,"" said Sumant Batra, managing partner at law firm Kesar Dass B & Associates, who is involved in several cases. Apart from the 12 companies which are already in various stages of resolution, at least 40 other companies are being reviewed by banks after an RBI directive and the ordinance will also have an impact on them.

" The detention of Binayak Sen, a respected doctor and civil rights activist, by the Chhattisgarh government is a blot on our democracy. The Chhattisgarh police arrested him a year ago under the Chhattisgarh Special Public Security Act, 2005 on charges of aiding Maoists. The police have charged Sen, winner of the 2008 Jonathan Mann award for global health and human rights instituted by the Global Health Council, of acting as a courier for Maoists. His appeal for bail has been turned down despite appeals from many public intellectuals across the world, including 22 Nobel laureates. Clearly, the court and police are unwilling to consider his exemplary record as a health and civil rights activist in one of the most underdeveloped regions of the country. The Chhattisgarh government's stance on the issue compromises its responsibility to the rights guaranteed by the Constitution. Every citizen has a right to speech and association and the government ought to protect these rights. Even if one assumes that Sen is sympathetic to Maoist ideology, as alleged by the police, he has a right to uphold his views unless proven to have violated the law in the process. He also has a right to a speedy and fair trial. Sen is held guilty by association and the government is unwilling to recognise its mistake despite pleas from all around. The Chhattisgarh government has a hard task at hand, no doubt. Maoists are a powerful threat and have stretched the resources of the government. Unfortunately, the government's policies to counter them are bad in law and practice. Security measures like Salwa Judum and harassment of political and civil rights activists have only eroded the credibility of the government. A strong civil society that vouchsafes political and economic rights is necessary to expose extremist ideologies like Maoism. As India sets out to expand its influence in global affairs, its record on civil rights will increasingly be under scrutiny. No government can claim special powers and suspend civil rights like freedom of speech and association. Extremist political groups like Maoists don't thrive because of a liberal legal framework, but they certainly would benefit from its absence. Sen's trial has now started after a year spent in prison. Scores of similar undertrials languishing in Indian jails fare worse. It just doesn't do any good to India's brand image as a country that protects civil rights. Democracy enhances India's soft power potential on the world stage. However, disregard for democratic rights will take the sheen off India's patchy but promising record as a liberal democracy.

" GUWAHATI: Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma has kicked up a storm with his remarks that some people suffer from life-threatening diseases such as cancer because of sins committed in the past which he called ""divine justice"". The comments sparked sharp reactions in the political circles and among cancer patients. ""God makes us suffer when we sin. Sometimes we come across young men getting inflicted with cancer or young men meeting with accidents. If you observe the background you will come to know that it's divine justice. Nothing else. We have to suffer that divine justice,"" Sarma said at a function organised for distribution of appointment letters to teachers here on Tuesday. ""In this lifetime or in our previous life, or perhaps my father or mother... perhaps that young man did not do but his father has done something wrong. It is mentioned even in Gita, Bible about the outcome of one's actions. No point in being sad... all will get the outcome of this life's actions in this life only. That divine justice always will be there. Nobody can escape the divine justice that will happen,"" he said. Reacting to the comments, Congress leader Debabratta Saikia on Wednesday said, ""It is unfortunate that the health minister has made such a remark on cancer patients hurting their feelings. As he has made the remark publicly, the minister should also apologise for it publicly."" AIUDF leader Aminul Islam asserted that the health minister made this remark to cover his failure to control the spread of cancer in the state. ""He has given up, he can't control,"" he said Some cancer patients said they were saddened by the health minister's remarks at a time when it is an established medical fact that there are scientific reasons and various other parameters responsible for the disease. State-run Dr B Barooah Cancer Institute's Medical Superintendent Dr B B Borthakur sought to downplay Sarma's remarks. ""I don't think the minister made the remark on scientific basis but in a social context as I understand. I don't think it is a matter to be made into a controversy. It is not a matter to be given so much importance,"" he told PTI.

" BEIJING: The Chinese foreign ministry on Thursday responded to a statement by its ambassador in India, Luo Zhaohui, who recently said Beijing is prepared to rename the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) to address India's concerns+ . The ministry neither endorsed nor denied Luo's statement, suggesting that it was encouraging Luo to negotiate with New Delhi over the issue, while ensuring that it did not upset Islamabad either. The ambassador had said during a speech in Delhi last week that China ""can change the name of CPEC"" and ""create an alternative corridor through Jammu & Kashmir, Nathu La pass or Nepal to deal with India's concerns"". In return, it was suggested that India join its One Belt One Road (OBOR) connectivity plan which desperately needs a boost from China's largest neighbour to its south. Chinese investments in Nepal and Myanmar are meant to pressure India to join the initiative but India has not responded to these overtures so far. The fact that Luo publicly discussed the possibility of renaming CPEC twice indicates that he was acting on instructions from Beijing and not expressing his personal views, observers said. The foreign ministry said on Thursday: ""CPEC is an economic cooperation Initiative that has nothing to do with territorial sovereignty disputes, and does not affect China's and Pakistan's position on the Kashmir issue."" Experts said that the mention of Pakistan in the statement was significant because Beijing does not want to hurt sentiments in the country until its envoy in New Delhi manages to strike a deal. The fact that it is interested in negotiating with India, sources said, was evident from the foreign ministry not contradicting its envoy in New Delhi. New Delhi believes Beijing has sided with Islamabad by including Pakistan's name in the project, which passes through a portion of Kashmir described as a part of India. At the same time, India's refusal to join OBOR is one of the major hindrances in OBOR's growth.+ Prime Minister Narendra Modi had made this clear when India became the first major country not to attend the OBOR forum in Beijing in May, whereas most western countries including the United States had sent official delegations. ""China is ready to strengthen connectivity with all neighbouring countries and promote regional economic cooperation and common prosperity,"" according to a translation of the ministry's statement which was released in Chinese. ""CPEC is a framework for cooperation focusing on the long-term development of cooperation in all fields. It is in the interest of both China and Pakistan. It is also conducive to promoting regional stability and development,"" it said.

" NEW DELHI: A key piece of research dug out after hours of pouring over UN voting records by a diligent junior official at India's permanent mission was instrumental in India torpedoing UK's unprecedented proposal for a Joint Conference mechanism to break the International Court of Justice (ICJ) deadlock. India's permanent representative to UN Syed Akbaruddin told TOI that the research by the official (name withheld on request) showed that in 1978, 2011 and 2014, ICJ elections were held over more sessions, more meetings and more rounds of ballots than in 2017. In the Dalveer Bhandari-Christopher Greenwood direct face-off, only 6 rounds of voting had been held. The contest between Bhandari and Greenwood+ was running its normal course until UK, as first reported by TOI on Sunday, added drama to it by proposing at an informal discussion of the Security Council that a Joint Conference of the Council and General Assembly be formed - and the voting stalled - to break the deadlock. Britain feared more rounds of voting would lead to Bhandari acquiring over 2/3rd support in the Assembly. Just how India fought off this proposal in the last 72 hours is the real story behind the re-election of Bhandari. Akbaruddin parried UK's proposal by laying out the research findings that in 1978 the Security Council had voted in 14 rounds, in 2014 the GA had voted in 15 rounds and in 12 rounds in 2011 without invoking any other mechanism. ""The findings also indicated that in each of the past elections final results were only at culmination of 4 sessions. And so there was no reason to go for a new mechanism even before the end of the 4th session,"" Akbaruddin told TOI. For India, ousting a P5 from its perch despite all other Permanent Members joining in support (they had together voted for Greenwood) is nothing short of historic. ""Simply put it has never ever happened before. It is therefore testimony of change that is underway. It shows that change is discernible and happens, if not by design then by chance,"" said India's top official at the UN. ""It is an acknowledgement that most countries recognise that India has credentials as a country for which space can be provided on important multilateral platforms. It reflects India's ability to harness broad based coalitions along a common vision of a more inclusive, open architecture of multilateralism that is appealing to large number of States,"" he added. Akbaruddin was humble in victory as he said the resolution of the issue with UK within a framework of common values that reflected ""the democratic spirit of the times"" indicated a certain maturity of approach. This approach allows for tough hard-nosed tactics during negotiations coupled with ability to arrive at solutions that leave space for collaboration and cooperation once the outcome is decided,"" he said. Britain too was gracious in defeat, acknowledging the significance of its bilateral ties with India, even though it bowed out saying that this was ""an ideal opportunity"" to hold a Joint Conference to break the deadlock. But, as Akbaruddin said, researching years of election proceedings of the ICJ going back to several decades helped India outwit UK on that unprecedented move. ","Akbaruddin parried UK's proposal by laying out the research findings that in 1978 the Security Council had voted in 14 rounds, in 2014 the GA had voted in 15 rounds and in 12 rounds in 2011 without invoking any other mechanism.

" NEW DELHI: The Rafale deal negotiated by the Modi government resulted in a substantial 350 million reduction for 36 aircraft in flyaway condition as compared with terms that were being considered by the UPA and there is a further 1,300 million saving for weapons, maintenance and training. Refuting the main opposition Congress's allegations+ that costs for acquiring the French fighter ballooned under NDA, well placed sources said a comparison of aircraft being purchased in flyaway condition shows savings adding up to a tidy Rs 12,600 crore and also pointed out that there had, in fact, been no deal under UPA. Congress spokespersons have alleged a sharp and unexplained increase in cost of manufacturing after NDA assumed office which meant the government could only afford to buy 36 aircraft without much-needed transfer of technology. The opposition suggested that cost per aircraft rose from Rs 526 crore to Rs 1,570 crore and said the government was uneasy over sharing data. Sources said a comparison of aircraft to be procured in flyaway condition demonstrates NDA's success in bettering the terms. Under the 126-aircraft contract contemplated by UPA, 18 aircraft were to be delivered in flyaway condition. NDA's reworked contract is for 36 aircraft in flyaway condition. UPA was getting 18 fighters for around 100 million each and the cost now is around 90 million per fighter. The current government also procured the Meteor missile that makes the fighter much more effective. In details revealed to TOI, sources said a major success of hard bargaining with Dassault Aviation, makers of Rafale, was favorable commercial terms for India. Payment terms for the 126 Rafales under the previous MMRCA (medium multi-role combat aircraft) project was based on a fixed escalation figure of 3.9%. The 36 Rafale fighters contracted by the Modi government are linked to a limit of 3.5%. This ensures an additional saving of around 200 million while it could add up to around 1 billion euros. The government has also argued that Dassault Aviation was unwilling to take responsibility of quality control of production for the 108 aircraft in India under terms negotiated by UPA. ""While Dassault provisioned for 3 crore man hours for production in India, HAL's (Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd) estimate was three times higher, escalating costs manifold,"" said a source. Sources challenged the claim that technology transfer was being considered and said what was on offer was just licence manufacturing technology. There was no agreement on crucial terms. Under the current deal's procurement offsets, the inter-governmental agreement states the French party will facilitate implementation of 'Make in India' by the industrial supplier, notably through offsets for 50% value of the supply protocol. Reacting to claims that a deal was nearly sealed when the Modi government assumed office, sources said there was no agreement and if there had been one, there would be debate. ""The acquisition of aircraft would have commenced,"" said the source. Apart from prolonged contract negotiations, there were reports that then defence minister A K Antony decided the approach of the contract negotiation committee needed to be examined and UPA was unable to close the deal despite request for proposal being issued in 2007. It has also been argued that PM Modi did not jump the gun in referring to the Rafale deal during his visit to France in 2015 as the joint statement said the two leaderships had agreed to conclude an inter-governmental agreement for supply of aircraft on terms that would be better conveyed by Dassault Aviation as part of a separate process underway. There would be a longer maintenance responsibility by France. It has been asserted that proposals were presented to the defence acquisition council thrice and thereafter a Cabinet Committee on Security nod was received following by the inter-governmental agreement in 2016. The government claims Dassault improved the terms while reducing delivery time frames.

" MYSURU: A frail octogenarian seeking alms near a Mysuru temple has donated Rs 2.5 lakh to the temple. For nearly a decade after she became weak and unable to work as a domestic help, MV Sitalakshmi, 85, would be seen begging at the entrance of the Prasanna Anjaneya Swamy Temple, Vontikoppal. Now, she has contributed Rs 2.5 lakh to improve the amenities and also to provide prasadam to devotees every year during Hanuma Jayanti. After hearing about her generous contribution, devotees to the temple greet her and even seek her blessings. Though she resides with her brother and sister-in-law in Yadavagri, Sitalakshmi doesn't want to depend on others. After she couldn't work anymore, she would sit at the temple through the day where she's taken care of by the temple authorities. Beggar was felicitated by MLA During the Ganesha festival, she donated nearly Rs 30,000 and a few days ago, she took the temple trust chairman to the bank and donated Rs 2 lakh. Altogether, she has contributed more than Rs 2.5 lakh to the temple. Sitalakshmi told TOI: ""I'd deposit whatever devotees gave me in the bank. For me, god is everything. Hence, I decided to donate money to the temple which takes care of me so well. Once a week, Rajeshwari, who works in the temple helps me take a bath. If I keep money, people will steal it and that's why I decided to donate my savings to the temple. My only wish is that the temple authorities provide prasadam to devotees during every Hanuma Jayanthi."" M Basavaraj, chairman of the temple trust, said: ""She is different and never demands devotees give her money; she just accepts what they give. She is generous when comes to contributing to the temple. She was felicitated by MLA Vasu during our temple function. After seeing her contributions to temple which we displayed in our temple, people have started to give her more. Some of them even give her Rs 100. Many devotees seek her blessing. We'll judiciously use her money and take care of her as well"". R Mariyappa, a retired KSRTC employee, said: ""When I heard about her generosity, I was amazed. Hats off to her."" Sitalakshmi's brother Kugeshan said, ""We're providing her the best possible care. A few years ago, she met with an accident and we provided her the best possible medical treatment. She doesn't want to stay at home; she goes to the temple in the morning and comes home late evening."" Her neighbours Rama and Uma, who were surprised to hear about her generous donation, told TOI: ""It's wonderful. Every day, she comes home and spends a few minutes with us before going to her brother's house. We've been seeing her for nearly 30 years.""

" NAGPUR: Indian captain Virat Kohli on Thursday complained that cramped schedules are getting in the way of proper preparation for big series such as the upcoming tour of South Africa, a criticism that the BCCI promised to address with ""utmost seriousness"". Speaking at the pre-match press conference ahead of the second Test against Sri Lanka in Nagpur tomorrow, Kohli said he was left with no choice but to seek bouncy tracks in the ongoing series as there was hardly any time in the schedule to prepare for the trip to South Africa. India would be leaving for South Africa for a series of three Tests, six ODIs and three Twenty20 Internationals, just a couple of days after the home series against Sri Lanka gets over on December 24. ""...unfortunately we get only two days before we fly to South Africa after this series gets over. So we have no choice but try to be in a game situation and think of what's coming ahead of us. ""Had we got a month off ideally, we would have done a proper preparation in a camp sort of scenario but we have to sort of make do with what we have."" The Indian team will finish their limited overs engagement against Sri Lanka on December 24 (final T20) before they fly off to South Africa on December 27. Acting BCCI president CK Khanna said the board needs to seriously assess Kohli's view. ""Virat is the Indian captain and his view point on cricketing matters should be taken with utmost seriousness. We are proud how the team is performing but if players are feeling fatigued, we need to have a broader view on the issue,"" Khanna told PTI. Kohli stressed on the necessity to space out series as at times, the team needs to do its preparation differently for a bigger series. ""As usual cramped for time, which I think we needed to assess in future as well because we very easily assess the team when go abroad but we don't look at how many days we have got to prepare before we go to a particular place to play,"" the skipper said ahead of the second Test against Sri Lanka, starting here tomorrow. Indian cricketers have been playing non-stop cricket since start of the IPL. The IPL was followed by ICC Champions Trophy, away tours of West Indies and Sri Lanka and three successive home series against Australia, New Zealand and Sri Lanka comprising 23 matches (3 Tests, 11 ODIs and 9 T20 Internationals). ""...everyone starts judging players when results come after Test matches. It should be a fair game, where we get to prepare the way we want to and then we are entitled to be criticised,"" Kohli stressed. Khanna said the BCCI needs to take a call on the spacing of matches while scheduling future home series. ""I think we should analyse if it is a good option to have three back-to-back series with hardly any break for the players. It will be great if this can also be included in the agenda for the December 9, Special General Meeting,"" Khanna said.

" NEW DELHI: In the wake of an ongoing investigation into a judicial nexus in illegal medical college admissions, the Supreme Court directed a Lucknow-based college on Thursday to pay Rs 10 lakh each to 150 students as compensation and sternly admonished a bench of the Allahabad high court for permitting the admissions. The court asked the college to refund the admission fee paid by the students and slapped a fine of Rs 25 lakh to be paid to the SC registry. It also barred the college from admitting students for the next academic year of 2018-19. Not mincing words while pulling up the division bench of the Allahabad HC for allowing the institute to admit students in violation of its order, a bench of Chief Justice Dipak Misra and Justices A M Khanwilkar and D Y Chandrachud said it was a case of ""judicial indiscipline and impropriety"". Senior advocate Vikas Singh and lawyer Gaurav Sharma, appearing for the Medical Council of India (MCI), told the bench that the HC allowed admissions even though the college didn't have formal permission from the Centre and failed to consider that the college suffered from deficiencies in infrastructure, clinical material and faculty. Moreover, the HC ignored the earlier SC order restraining any interim order in this regard. The apex court said the HC bench had virtually overruled the SC order, transgressing all rules and regulations. ""It is most unfortunate, which may cause [an] institutional problem,"" the bench said and hinted that it may address the issue on the administrative side. Senior advocate Rajeev Dhavan, appearing for the college, said the institution should not be punished for the HC's wrong verdict but the bench remained firm. A bench of the Allahabad HC was recently in the news after the CBI arrested a retired judge of the Orissa HC, I M Quddusi, for allegedly conspiring to facilitate a favourable order for a college run by Prasad Education Trust also a Lucknow-based institution. Quddusi had earlier served in the Allahabad HC. The SC's order assumes significance in view of allegations of a middlemen-judges nexus for getting favourable judgments in cases of medical admissions. The CBI arrested Quddusi and five others for allegedly conspiring to ""settle"" an MCI order debarring a private medical college from MBBS admissions. The case exposed the rot and corruption in medical education. Quddusi has been accused by CBI of offering ""legal guidance"" to the promoters of the private medical college on how to get around the admission ban and even promising suitable orders from the apex court. Investigating agencies have also lodged an FIR against two IAS officers serving in Puducherry former health secretary B R Babu and Narendra Kumar, who headed the committee on admissions to medical colleges for allegedly denying admissions to deserving students and selling seats to others at ""exorbitant"" rates. Coming down heavily on GCRG Memorial Trust, which runs the college in Lucknow, the bench said it had illegally admitted students and jeopardised their careers. Quashing their admission, the bench said the college must compensate them for playing with their careers and ""polluting young minds"" by admitting them in violation of the law. In the current case, the court had earlier passed an order restraining the HC from issuing any interim order pertaining to the academic year 2017-18. The HC, however, went ahead and allowed the college to admit students for the current session, drawing the SC's ire. ""We really fail to fathom the manner in which the high court has misconstrued our order and passed the final order for 2017-18. We are issuing notice only to test the propriety of the order and also if the institution is eligible to get the renewal of letter of permission for 2018-19,"" the bench had said while entertaining an appeal filed by MCI.

" NEW DELHI: Unhappy with the price hike introduced by restaurants+ after a steep reduction in the goods and services tax (GST)+ , the government is looking to invoke anti-profiteering provisions. While restaurants are free to alter prices on account of higher costs, most have said the latest hike was the result of the GST Council's decision to do away with input tax credit while lowering the levy from 18% to 5%. ""If the impact of withdrawal of input tax credit is a sharp increase, they should have also reduced prices by a similar margin when GST was introduced in July. It is a fit case of anti-profiteering action,"" a senior finance ministry official told TOI. The official said the law allowed the government to take suo motu action apart from acting on specific complaints. ""We will levy the maximum possible penalty if profiteering is established,"" the source, who did not wish to be identified, added. A host of chains, from McDonalds, and Starbucks+ to Domino's Pizza, have already hiked the base price, while others such as KFC are planning to follow suit by next week. The National Restaurants Association of India, which was lobbying on behalf of the organised sector, had estimated the input tax credit withdrawal would push up menu prices by 6-7%. In contrast, it had told the government that GST had resulted in a small gain of around 1% for restaurants. While other associations have welcomed the move, NRAI members are seen to have moved to challenge the GST Council's action, setting the stage for a possible escalation in the battle. On Thursday, the Union Cabinet had announced the establishment of an anti-profiteering body and has asked consumers to highlight cases of businesses pocketing gains since the launch of GST . The finance ministry decided to withdraw the benefit of tax credit available on inputs as well as on rent after it noticed that the gain had not been passed on to consumers through a reduction in menu prices from July. Besides, it was finding it difficult to implement the scheme and convinced states to go ahead with the withdrawal of tax credits.

" CAIRO: Attackers killed at least 235 worshippers Friday in a bomb and gun assault on a packed mosque in Egypt's restive North Sinai province, in the country's deadliest attack in recent memory. A bomb explosion ripped through the Rawda mosque, roughly 40 kilometres (25 miles) west of the North Sinai capital of El-Arish, before gunmen opened fire on the Sufi worshippers gathered there for weekly Friday prayers, officials said. Witnesses said the assailants surrounded the mosque with all-terrain vehicles and then planted a bomb outside. The gunmen then mowed down the panicked worshippers as they tried to flee and used congregants' vehicles they had set alight to block routes to the mosque. Egyptian air force jets later destroyed vehicles used in the attack and ""terrorist"" locations where weapons and ammunition were stocked, an army spokesman said on Friday. The planes ""destroyed several vehicles used in the attack,"" Tamer el-Refai said. The state prosecutor's office said in a statement that 235 people were killed and 109 wounded in the attack, the scale of which is unprecedented in a four-year insurgency by Islamist extremist groups. Between ten and 20 armed attackers ""entered the mosque, killing more people than they injured,"" Magdy Rizk, who was wounded in the attack, told AFP. ""They were wearing masks and military uniforms,"" he said, adding that the area was predominantly Sufi and that locals have received threats from extremist groups. US President Donald Trump condemned on Twitter the ""horrible and cowardly terrorist attack on innocent and defenceless worshippers"". A furious Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi declared three days of mourning and pledged to ""respond with brutal force"". ""The army and police will avenge our martyrs and return security and stability with force in the coming short period,"" he added in a televised speech. Russian President Vladimir Putin sent condolences to Sisi, calling the attack ""striking for its cruelty and cynicism"", while condemnations poured in from Israel, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia and other countries. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also condemned the ""barbaric"" terror attack. UK foreign minister Boris Johnson decried the ""barbaric attack"", while his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian labelled it ""despicable"". Pope Francis and Egypt's highest Muslim religious authority joined in the condemnation. ""His Holiness joins all people of good will in imploring that hearts hardened by hatred will learn to renounce the way of violence,"" the pope's office said. The grand imam of Cairo's Al-Azhar, Sheikh Ahmed el-Tayeb, condemned ""in the strongest terms this barbaric terrorist attack"". There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bloodshed. The Islamic State group's Egypt branch has killed hundreds of policemen and soldiers, and also civilians accused of working with the authorities, in attacks in the north of the Sinai peninsula. They have also targeted followers of the mystical Sufi branch of Sunni Islam as well as Christians. The victims of Friday's attack included civilians and conscripts praying at the mosque. A tribal leader and head of a Bedouin militia that fights IS told AFP that the mosque is known as a place where Sufis gather. The Islamic State group shares the puritan Salafi view that Sufis are heretics for seeking the intercession of saints. The jihadists had previously kidnapped and beheaded an elderly Sufi leader, accusing him of practising magic which Islam forbids, and abducted Sufi practitioners later released after ""repenting"". An IS propaganda outlet had published an interview earlier with the commander of its ""morality police"" in Sinai who said their ""first priority was to combat the manifestations of polytheism including Sufism"". The group has killed more than 100 Christians in church bombings and shootings in Sinai and other parts of Egypt, forcing many to flee the peninsula. The military has struggled to quell jihadists who pledged allegiance to IS in November 2014. IS regularly conducts attacks against soldiers and policemen in the peninsula bordering Israel and the Gaza Strip, although the frequency and scale of such attacks has diminished over the past year. The jihadists have since increasingly turned to civilian targets, attacking not only Christians and Sufis but also Bedouin Sinai inhabitants accused of working with the army. The Gaza Strip's border crossing with Egypt that had been due to reopen Saturday will remain closed until further notice because of the attack, a Palestinian official said. Aside from IS, Egypt also faces a threat from Al-Qaeda-aligned jihadists who operate out of neighbouring Libya. A group calling itself Ansar al-Islam -- Supporters of Islam in Arabic -- claimed an October ambush in Egypt's Western Desert that killed at least 16 policemen. Many of those killed belonged to the interior ministry's secretive National Security Service. The military later conducted air strikes on the attackers, killing their leader Emad al-Din Abdel Hamid, a most wanted jihadist who was a military officer before joining an Al-Qaeda-affiliated group in Libya's militant stronghold of Derna.

" NEW DELHI: Fortis Memorial Research Institute (Gurgaon) charged the family of a seven-year-old dengue patient almost Rs 16 lakh for 15 days in the ICU, but the girl died while being shifted from Fortis to Rockland Hospital. Union health minister J P Nadda on Monday assured the bereaved family of action in the matter following an uproar on social media sites. Fortis denied any wrongdoing. It said all standard medical protocols were followed in treating Adya Singh and all clinical guidelines were adhered to. In a "" detailed clarification"" submitted to the health minister, Fortis said it had charged Rs 15.79 lakh. It all started with a post on Twitter by the bereaved father's friend on November 17. ""One of my batchmate's 7 year old was in @fortis hospital for 15 days for dengue. Billed Rs 18 lakhs including for 2700 gloves. She passed away at the end of it. Corrupt a*******,"" he wrote. ? The message was retweeted 9,000 times in four days, prompting a reply from the health minister. ""Please provide me details on hfwminister@gov.in. We will take all necessary action,"" Nadda tweeted. TOI spoke to the bereaved father who alleged the hospital had misguided them throughout. ""The government must act against them so that no hospital deals with its patients like this again,"" Jayant Singh, an IT professional based in Dwarka said. He took a personal loan of Rs 5 lakh, in addition to financial support from family and his own savings, to pay for the treatment of his daughter, Adya, who is no more. Adya, a Class II student, developed very high fever on August 27. Her family said they had rushed her to Rockland Hospital in Dwarka two days later when the fever did not abate. Tests confirmed she was suffering from dengue. However, her condition worsened and Rockland suggested Singh take her to a bigger hospital. The family took her to Fortis Hospital in Gurgaon on August 31. Initially, she was given intravenous fluids and supportive treatment as there was a progressive fall in her platelet count. But when Adya's condition did not improve, she was put on mechanical ventilation and intubated. She remained on life support for 10 days, the family alleged, and during this time the hospital billed them heavily. ""They have charged for 1,600 gloves, 660 syringes, high-end antibiotics and sugar strips which I am not sure were even used,"" the family alleged. They added: ""On September 14, when an MRI was finally conducted and it revealed extensive damage to the brain, the doctors gave up. We decided to then take her to another hospital but doctors refused to even facilitate an ambulance."" Fortis Healthcare denied any wrongdoing. ""We empathise with Baby Adya's family in this difficult hour of sorrow and grief. Seven year old Baby Adya was brought in to Fortis Memorial Research Institute (Gurgaon), from another private hospital on the morning of 31st August, 2017. She was admitted with Severe Dengue which progressed to Dengue shock syndrome and was managed on IV fluids and supportive treatment as there was a progressive fall in platelet count and hemoconcentration. As her condition deteriorated, she had to be put on ventilatory support within 48 hours. The family was kept informed of the critical condition of the child and the poor prognosis in these situations. As a process, we counselled the family daily on the condition of the child. On 14th September, 2017, family decided to take her away from the hospital against medical advice (LAMA - Leave Against Medical Advice) and she succumbed the same day,"" it said. ""An itemized bill spread over 20 pages was explained and handed over to the family at the time of their departure from the hospital. Patient was treated in the Paediatric ICU for 15 days and was critical right from the time of admission, requiring intensive monitoring. Treatment during these 15 days included mechanical ventilation, high frequency ventilation, continuous renal replacement therapy, intravenous antibiotics, inotropes, sedation and analgesia. Care of ventilated patients in ICU requires a high number of consumables as per globally accepted infection control protocols. All consumables are transparently reflected in records and charged as per actuals,"" FHL added. ","The family took her to Fortis Hospital in Gurgaon on August 31.

" KAKAMIGAHARA (Japan): Goalkeeper Savita produced a stunning save in a tense shootout as India won the Asia Cup to secure qualification in next year's hockey World Cup following a nerve-wracking win over China in the final here on Sunday. The team broke a 13-year-old jinx when skipper Rani scored the final goal and Savita foiled an attempt from the rivals to ensure a 5-4 win. India had failed to qualify for the last World Cup and finished ninth in the 2010 edition. Wish India women's hockey team Rani scored twice while Monica, Lilima Minz and Navjot scored a goal each in the shootout. Earlier, it was Navjot Kaur who scored India's lone goal in the 25th minute while China found a late equaliser through Tiantian Luo, who converted a penalty corner in the 47th minute. It was in 2004 when the Indian women's team had clinched the Asia Cup trophy by beating Japan 1-0. It was advantage China right at the start as a stick check in the circle saw India concede a penalty corner in the second minute of the game. However, Savita was at her best and padded it away while an alert Deep Grace cleared the ball. Soon after, Indian forwards launched a swift attack with Navneet Kaur and Vandana working in tandem to find space in the Chinese D but an attentive Wang Na averted danger. China, meanwhile, won their second PC but Savita was spot on yet again to pad away Meiyu Liang's flick. With the first quarter ending in a stalemate, India came back looking determined to find a breakthrough. The Indian forwards kept the pressure on China as they made brave forays into the striking circle. Navjot came close to converting a field goal in the 17th minute but her diving effort was blocked, even as skipper Rani made a quick attempt to find a deflection. It was not until the 25th minute when India found their first breakthrough as Navneet and Rani played give-and-take before penetrating the circle, only to assist Navjot, who took a clear shot on goal. Though China launched a counterattack soon after, Indian defenders were up to the task. India began the third quarter rather positively as they stayed persistent with an aggressive attack. They dominated ball possession with accurate passing, rotating the ball and testing China's patience. Neha Goyal and Lilima Minz showcased good dribbling skills to steer past Chinese defenders but a second goal remained elusive even as the clock ticked away. On China's part, they stayed disciplined in their defence to deny India a chance to score through a PC. The final quarter was tense as China won a PC through successful video referral in the 47th minute. Tiantian Luo kept low as she improvised from the injection to find the right corner of the post, scoring a sensational equaliser. The following minutes saw both teams play at par with each other and not allowing either of them to stay in control. With nine minutes left for the final hooter, India upped the ante, desperately trying to find a gap in the 15-yard mark, but the Chinese defenders were resolute. Meanwhile, China won their fourth PC of the match with little less than three minutes to go for the final whistle. But it was brilliantly saved by rusher Sunita Lakra and almost immediately, India launched a counterattack but only to send the ball wide off the target and complete the full time in a stalemate. Savita was adjudged Goalkeeper of the Tournament. The men's team had also emerged Asia Cup champions early this year.

" CHENNAI/HYDERABAD: Police on Monday arrested a Tamil Nadu-cadre trainee IPS officer after Intelligence Bureau officers caught him cheating in the Union Public Service Commission (Main) Examination at a test centre in Egmore, Chennai. Investigators said Safeer Karim, an assistant superintendent of police in Nanguneri, Tirunelveli, took a cellphone, a Bluetooth-enabled miniature camera in a shirt button and wireless earpieces into the examination hall in Presidency Girls Higher Secondary School. ""Karim's wife, Joicy Joy, dictated the answers to him from Hyderabad,"" an investigating officer said. The Hyderabad police made coordinated arrests, taking Joy into custody at `La Excellence IAS -The Institute for Civil Services' at Ashok Nagar Crossroads in Hyderabad, where she was a visiting faculty member, as well as the institute's director and Karim's friend, P Rambabu. ""Karim wanted to join the IAS, so he took the UPSC exams again,"" the officer said. Karim, from Aluva, Kerala, who ranked 112 in a second attempt at the UPSC exams in 2015 after falling short in the interview the previous year, is an electronics engineer and proprietor of Karim's IAS, which trains civil service candidates and has branches in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. The officer said the IB, suspecting that Karim had cheated in the first of five tests in the UPSC examinations on Saturday, had put him under surveillance. They also monitored his wife. Four IB sleuths followed him to the examination hall on Monday where Karim successfully tricked a couple of policemen who were frisking candidates at the entry. ""Karim handed over his wallet and a cellphone to them from his trouser pockets, apologizing for forgetting to leave the handset in his car,"" the officer said. ""But he had concealed another phone and wireless earpieces in his socks and a miniature camera in his shirt."" The three-hour examination started at 9am. Twenty minutes later, IB sleuths entered the hall, searched Karim and seized the cellphone, which had concealed under his seat, the camera and earpieces. Police on Tuesday night produced Karim before a magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody. Officers said he faces dismissal from the IPS because he is still on probation. Friends told investigators that after Karim met with an accident recently and failed police fitness tests, he believed he did not have a viable future unless he opted for the IAS, the officer said. They told officers that Karim had been a topper in the CAT business school entrance exam, but in 2015 set up institutes in Kerala to train students for the civil service exams. Kareem met Joy when she took a job as an economics teacher at his academy and married her in 2016.

" RIYADH: Syrias disparate opposition groups announced an agreement early on Friday to send a united delegation to next weeks UN-brokered peace talks in Geneva, as international diplomatic efforts intensify to end the six-year conflict. The announcement came on the second day of a Saudi-sponsored meeting in Riyadh, where around 140 opposition figures are gathered to unify their ranks before direct talks with Syrian President Bashar al-Assads regime on November 28. Several rounds of talks hosted by the United Nations have failed to bring an end to the Syrian conflict, which has killed more than 330,000 people since 2011 and forced millions from their homes. We have agreed with the groups here in Riyadh, along with the Cairo and Moscow platforms, to form one united delegation to participate in the Geneva talks, Syrian opposition member Bassma Kodmani told reporters in Riyadh. Kodmani added that further meetings would be held on Friday to finalise the names and number of representatives each group would have in the 50-strong unified delegation. The delegates at the meeting have been under heavy pressure to row back on some of their more radical demands after a series of battlefield victories that have given Assads regime the upper hand. A Cairo-based Syrian opposition group agreed to join ranks with other opposition clusters including the Saudi-backed High Negotiations Committee (HNC) the largest bloc in the opposition and the Istanbul-based National Coalition. After prolonged discussions that dragged into the night, Moscow-based Syrian opposition group also appeared to have joined forces with that delegation. But there were still lingering differences. Kodami said the HNC and its closest allies maintained their longstanding demand that Assad step down from power as a prerequisite for a transitional phase to end the Syrian war, prompting reservations from the Moscow group. Several key opposition figures boycotted the meeting, including the Moscow groups Jamil and Riad Hijab of the HNC. Hijab stepped down as leader of the Saudi-backed HNC this week over attempts to lower the ceiling of the revolution and prolong the regime.

" BAGHDAD: Iraqi forces said on Friday that the militant Islamic State group fighters are withdrawing deep into the desert to escape an offensive aimed at a final defeat of the jihadists. IS has already been driven out of all of the towns it once held, but Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi has said he will not proclaim victory until the jihadists have been cleared from the western desert bordering Syria. The Hashed al-Shaabi (Popular Mobilisation) paramilitary force said its fighters had taken control of 77 villages and hamlets since the launch of the offensive on Thursday morning. It said five jihadists had been killed south of the ancient desert city of Hatra, but otherwise IS had put up little resistance. The Hashed said that its fighters, who are mainly recruited from Shia militias, overran an airfield in the same area, where they discovered underground warehouses used by the jihadists. Air support for the offensive, which also involves the army and federal police, has so far been provided exclusively by the Iraqi air force.

" Argentinas president said Friday an international search will continue for a submarine carrying 44 crew members that has been lost in the South Atlantic for nine days and that the subs disappearance will be investigated. The Argentine navy says an explosion occurred near the time and place where the submarine went missing on November 15 as it was sailing from the extreme southern port of Ushuaia to the coastal city of Mar del Plata. Thats led some family members of the crew to give up hope of a rescue. Navy officials and external experts also worry that even if the sub is intact but submerged, its crew may be running out of oxygen. The disappearance and current search of the ARA San Juan submarine has touched all Argentines. Its a difficult moment for all, but obviously, especially for the families of the 44 crew members, President Mauricio Macri said in his first public comments about the missing sub at the navys headquarters in Buenos Aires. Im here to guarantee you that we will carry on with the search, especially now that we have the support of all the international community. More than a dozen airplanes and ships have been participating in the multinational search across an area of some 185,000 square miles (480,000 square kilometers), which is roughly the size of Spain. The Argentine navy said Friday that Russia is sending an Antonov transport aircraft, and a ship in the southern Patagonian port of Comodoro Rivadavia is being adapted to carry a U.S. Navy submarine rescue chamber. They will focus the search efforts on a smaller area where the explosion was recorded. The ARA San Juan, a German-built diesel-electric TR-1700 class submarine, was commissioned in 1985 and was most recently refitted in 2014. No one goes out to sea knowing that they can lose their life, said Ramon Francisco Escobar, who was part of the crew that first brought the sub from Germany to Argentina in 1985. It was a reliable submarine. The sub was originally scheduled to arrive Monday to a navy base in Mar del Plata, about 250 miles (400 kilometers) southeast of Buenos Aires. Local residents prayed for the crews return during a religious ceremony and later sang Argentinas national anthem outside the base Friday. Some relatives of the crew who have gathered there fear that their loved ones will no longer be rescued. Hope is the last thing you lose. Im waiting for a surprise, but Im not really counting on it, Luis Tagliapietra, father of 27-year-old crew member Alejandro Damian Tagliapietra, told The Associated Press. You go from denial to suffering, from optimism to pessimism, he said, holding back tears. When he found out about the explosion from his sons direct superior, he was told that there was a possibility there were no survivors. I asked them if they were all dead, and he said: Yes. Some family members have denounced the navys response to the disappearance and the condition of the 30-year-old vessel. Although Macri said that its not the time to point fingers at anyone, he promised a probe of the subs disappearance. This demands a serious, deep investigation, Macri said.

" The Dalai Lama on Thursday said Tibetans were no longer looking for independence, but for development, and for that it is in our interest to remain with China. He also said India and China should eventually find respect for each other, and they have to live side-by-side. Speaking at an event organised by the Indian Chamber of Commerce on the Revival of Ancient Knowledge in Kolkata, he said, Past is past, we have to look towards future. Since 1974 we are not seeking independence. Tibetans also want modernised Tibet. We need more material development. For that, remaining with China is in our interest, provided they respect Tibets unique culture and heritage, he said, adding, Eventually we should imagine the world without armament. In my lifetime, this will not be achieved. But the 21st-century generation should keep this in mind eventually this world should be demilitarised. When asked about the recent controversy, in which China objected to President Ram Nath Kovinds visit to Arunachal, the Dalai Lama said problems and disputes will keep cropping up between the two nations, but when such an issue arises, both countries need to resort to dialogue to mitigate the conflict. India and China should eventually find respect for Hindi-Chini bhai bhai. China needs India, India needs China and they have to live side-by-side. There is no other way except to live peacefully and help each other, he added. Exhorting people to solve problems through dialogue without losing compassion, the spiritual leader, who has lived in India in self-imposed exile since 1959, advocated the formation of a European Union-like entity in Asia. I always admire the spirit of European Union. They recognise that Europe is more important than different nations. I feel (there should be an) union in Asia India, China, Japan and small countries in this area, he added. Talking of American policy in the Middle East, the Tibetan spiritual leader said former US President George W Bushs motivation to bring democracy in Iraq had been good, but his method was wrong. He is a wonderful person. We immediately developed a close level human interaction when we first met. I told him I respect you but I have great reservation for some of your policies, said the Dalai Lama. He said he immediately struck a chord with the junior Bush, who was informal, as opposed to Bill Clinton, whom he only became friends with after a series of meetings. There are a lot of problems (in Iraq). Now, there is a bad relation with many in the Muslim community. If he was not using force, and used more money for education and scholarships for students, then situation would have been different, he said. Speaking on the revival of ancient knowledge, the Dalai Lama said that ancient Indian knowledge was lost in India more than in any other part of the world. He said that he was committed to the revival of ancient Indian knowledge through education. It is only through the secular nature of education that society can change for the better, he said.

" Dhaka: Bangladesh and Myanmar have agreed to take assistance from the UN refugee agency for the repatriation of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims, Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali said on Saturday. The two governments signed a pact on Thursday settling the terms of the repatriation process, and the return of the Rohingya to Myanmar is expected to start in two months. Uncertainty over whether the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) would have a role had prompted rights groups to insist that outside monitors were needed to safeguard the Rohingyas return. More than 6,00,000 Rohingya sought sanctuary in Bangladesh after Myanmars military launched a brutal counter-insurgency in their villages across the northern parts of Rakhine State following attacks by Rohingya militants on an army base and police posts on 25 August. The signing of the deal is a first step. The two countries will now have to work on more steps, Ali told a news conference. Both countries agreed to take assistance from the UNHCR in the Rohingya repatriation process, he said. Myanmar will take its assistance as per their requirement. A joint working group of the three parties will be formed within three weeks and the group will fix the final terms to start the repatriation process, said Ali. Our priority is to ensure their safe return to their homeland with honour, the minister said. After repatriation, Rohingya Muslims will be kept at makeshift camps near to their abandoned homes, he said. Homes have been burnt to the ground in Rakhine, that need to be rebuilt. We have proposed Myanmar to take help from India and China for building camps for them, the minister said. The UN and United States have described the militarys actions as ethnic cleansing, and rights groups have accused Myanmars security forces of atrocities, including mass rape, arson and killings. Under the deal, Myanmar will take measures to see that the returnees will not be settled in temporary places for a long time and Myanmar will issue them an identity card for national verification immediately on their return.

" The incident at the busy Oxford Circus area here on Friday that sparked a mass evacuation and left 16 people injured was caused by an altercation between two men, police said, ruling out a terror attack. The Oxford Circus area, one of the busiest shopping zones in the heart of the city, was placed under temporary lockdown after police received reports of shots being fired. However, Scotland Yard later released CCTV images, saying an altercation between two men led to the chaos in the area. We are releasing CCTV images of two men we would like to speak with, following the incident at Oxford Circus earlier today, the Metropolitan Police said. The British Transport Police (BTP) said the altercation took place inside the busy Oxford Circus underground train station, triggering a mass evacuation. Officers believe an altercation erupted between two men on the platform. They would now like to speak to these two people in the CCTV images, who they believe may have information about the incident and the circumstances around the incident, a BTP statement said. They would also like to speak to anyone who was at the station or in the area at the time and saw or heard anything that would have caused mass evacuation, it added. One person was transferred to a major trauma centre for leg injuries, while eight people were taken to central London hospitals for minor injuries. Another seven patients were treated at the scene. The London Ambulance Service said the injuries were sustained as passengers fled from Oxford Circus Tube station, in what witnesses said was a stampede. Police said they received reports of shots being fired at a number of locations near Oxford Street, maintaining that there was significant panic. But later they found no evidence of any suspects or any gunfire and informed the public that it was safe to return to the area. Our response on Oxford Street has now been stood down. If you sought shelter in a building please now leave, the Met said in a statement. We have not located any trace of suspects, evidence of shots fired or casualties, it added. The police had, earlier, said that given the nature of the reports, they had responded as if the incident was terrorist related. Armed officers and fire engines had been rushed to the area, where eyewitnesses reported scenes of stampede as reports of suspected shots being fired caused panic and chaos. The Oxford Circus and a neighbouring area were placed under temporary lockdown as police investigated the cause of the panic. BBC reporter Helen Bushby said she had seen a mass stampede of people running away from the underground station at Oxford Circus. People had been screaming and crying, she said. Two underground stations in the heart of the city - the Oxford Circus and Bond Street - which had been shut down, reopened soon after and the area seems to be returning to normalcy. The always busy area was particularly heaving with crowds of shoppers and tourists on account of the worldwide Black Friday discount shopping day.

" Harare: Zimbabwes military action leading to Robert Mugabes resignation was legal, a high court judge has ruled, in a key decision as the military seeks to show that its moves were not a coup. Experts said it sets a dangerous precedent for the military to step in again. High court judge George Chiweshe on Friday ruled that the militarys actions in intervening to stop the takeover of Mugabes functions by those around him are constitutionally permissible and lawful. The military stepped in almost two weeks ago after Mugabes firing of deputy Emmerson Mnangagwa amid fears that the 93-year-old presidents unpopular wife was positioning herself to take power. The judge said the actions ensured that non-elected individuals do not exercise executive functions, an apparent reference to then-first lady Grace Mugabe. Separately, the judge said Mugabes firing of Mnangagwa as vice president was illegal. Mnangagwa was sworn in as president on Friday in a whirlwind reversal of fortunes, becoming just the second leader of Zimbabwe after Mugabes 37-year-rule. The judges decisions were quickly criticized both by legal and rights experts and by close allies of Mugabe and his wife. If these breathtaking High Court Orders granted in Harare yesterday represent what is being peddled as a new path, then please pray for Zimbabwe, tweeted minister of higher education Jonathan Moyo, the most vocal of the Mugabes allies. The southern Africa director for Human Rights Watch, Dewa Mavhinga, called the rulings incredible and said on Twitter: Strange, captured judiciary? Zimbabwes military sent tanks into the streets overnight on 14 November, taking control of the state broadcaster and announcing that Robert Mugabe had been put under house arrest. It said it was pursuing criminals close to Mugabe accused of harming the countrys economy. The militarys move led the ruling party to turn against Mugabe, launching impeachment proceedings before Mugabe on Tuesday announced his resignation, while tens of thousands of Zimbabweans took to the streets in a military-backed demonstration urging him to step aside. Mnangagwa, who fled the country shortly after his firing, said upon his return he had been in constant contact with the military during his absence. Many in the international community have avoided calling the militarys actions a coup, instead urging that Zimbabwes authorities respect the rule of law. Some Zimbabweans have congratulated the military, taking selfies with soldiers and sending up a cheer for army commander Constantino Chiwenga at Fridays inauguration. Zimbabwean lawyer Alex Magaisa said the judges rulings may come to haunt Mnangagwas government by setting a precedent in effectively legalizing military intervention in the affairs of government. He also wrote Saturday that it is interesting to note that the order was granted by consent which suggests that Mugabe agreed to it. If he did, it could be that it was part of Mugabes exit deal. Mugabe has not been seen in public since his speech on Sunday defying calls to resign. He will remain in Zimbabwe, and Mnangagwa met him on Thursday and assured him of maximum security, the state-run Zimbabwe Herald reported. Mugabe did not attend the swearing-in of Mnangagwa, a 75-year-old former defence and justice minister blamed for a number of crackdowns under Mugabes rule. In his first speech as president, Mnangagwa spoke of reuniting the country and reaching out to the world after years of international condemnation and sanctions over rights abuses and allegedly rigged elections. Let bygones be bygones, he said. He has warned against vengeful retribution. The legality of the military takeover is also under scrutiny in new cases against several officials linked to the ruling party faction of Mugabes wife. Their lawyers say they were illegally detained by soldiers for days. Innocent Hamandishe, a member of the ruling ZANU-PF partys youth league who has been linked to a statement critical of the military, was abducted on 16 November and only handed over to police on Wednesday, said his lawyer, Emmanuel Samudombe. He appeared in court on Saturday. Its a serious breach of the constitution, Samudombe said. Charges against Hamandishe include causing disaffection in the security forces during the militarys intervention. The lawyer described the case as retribution but said he would wait to see how authorities deal with it in light of Mnangagwas comments urging Zimbabweans not to settle old scores. Change is good, the change is proper. But we feel that theres a dark side to it, the lawyer said of the charges. Theres something fishy in the whole matter. Other officials facing charges include finance minister Ignatious Chombo and Kudzanai Chipanga of the ZANU-PFs youth league. Chombo was appearing in court on Saturday after accusations of corrupt land deals dating back to his time as minister in charge of local government, his lawyer Lovemore Madhuku said. Chombo was assaulted after the military moved in, the lawyer said, and is now in police custody. Charges against him were read out Thursday while he lay in bed at a government-run hospital, his lawyer said. Whatever one might think of coups in principle, one would have to concede that this one was artfully contrived and executed, showing a smiling face to the world to avoid regional sanctions, wrote Peter Fabricius, a consultant with the Institute for Security Studies. Mugabe had the chance to protest to South African envoys who met with him shortly after the military stepped in, Fabricius added. Mugabe could have screamed Help! But he didnt, South Africas defense minister later told local Radio 702: Well, according to Mugabe, nothing; hes happy, she said. ","If he did, it could be that it was part of Mugabes exit deal.

" Hafiz Saeed, the mastermind of the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, walked free on Friday after nine-and-a-half months of house arrest without any charges. The global reaction was expected to be harsh. But for many in Pakistan, it was news much expected. They have seen this happening over and over again. In December 2001, former military ruler Pervez Musharraf put Saeed under house arrest and banned his organisation, Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT), for its involvement in the Indian Parliament attack. After a few months, he walked free. When he was arrested in May 2002, he moved the Lahore High Court and got a reprieve as the government failed to file any charges. The latest episode is not entirely different. Saeed was detained on January 31 this year, after Pakistani newspapers reported that the U.S. threatened sanctions against Islamabad if he was not put behind bars. Both the Pakistani government and the military at that time indicated that they were serious in cracking down on Saeeds networks. Then Interior Minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan had said in Islamabad that the government was deliberating actions on the fate of the Jamaat ud-dawa (JuD), the frontal organisation of the LeT. The military said the house arrest of Saeed was a policy decision taken in the national interest. But Saeed moved the Lahore High Court against the house arrest. On one side, government lawyers kept requesting the court to extend the detention, pointing out that his release could lead to a cut in international aid for Pakistan. But on the other, the government dropped terrorism charges against Saeed, and paved the way for his eventual release. This drama continued for nearly 40 weeks before the court finally ordered Saeeds release. This time, however, the plot appears to be thicker than usual. Days after former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was disqualified on July 28, Saeeds aides launched a political party, Milli Muslim League (MML). Despite not being registered by the Election Commission, the party contested the byelection for the seat vacated by Mr. Sharif. It lost the election, but got a sizeable chunk of votes. Political entry This triggered a debate in Pakistan on whether Saeed was planning to enter mainstream politics. Former General Amjad Shoaib told the media that there was a secret plan floated by the Inter-Service Intelligence to bring the JuD into the political mainstream. Before the government could even consider the plan, it was being implemented, as was seen in the byelection. The Sharif government still refused to give security clearance to the MML, which, in turn, allowed the Election Commission to stop its registration. Military spokesperson Major-Gen. Asif Ghafoor responded to this by saying that every Pakistani has the right to participate in the political process. It is a tricky situation. There is no clear national policy on the JuD, said Zahid Hussain, a security analyst and author of Frontline Pakistan and Scorpion's Tale. International pressure is quite logical. Pakistan itself has acknowledged elements within this group have masterminded the Mumbai terrorist attacks, he said. A government source claimed that there was a lot of pressure on the authorities to issue the MML the required security clearance. Mr. Sharif appeared to have resisted the pressure. No wonder Saeed called him a traitor in his first public appearance after being released. It is to be seen what Mr. Sharifs successor will do on the MML. (Mubashir Zaidi writes for The Hindu and is based in Karachi) ","A government source claimed that there was a lot of pressure on the authorities to issue the MML the required security clearance.

" Police and paramilitary troops on Saturday cracked down on a protest by religious groups at a major entry point to Islamabad that has been blocked for the last 20 days. Scores were reportedly injured and one policeman was killed in the clash. The protesters are demanding the resignation of Law Minister Zahid Hamid over a controversial amendment in the Constitution where the oath for the minority Qadiani sect was replaced. Though the government and Parliament had withdrawn the amendment, religious parties are still clamouring for Mr. Hamids resignation. As negotiations between the protesters and the authorities broke down on Friday night, thousands of policemen and paramilitary troops teargassed the protesters and burnt their camps at Faizabad. Life across country hit As the news spread, followers of the groups led by the newly-formed Labbaik Pakistan a religious party came out on the streets in various cities and staged sit-ins crippling life across the country. Thousands of people were stranded on the roads as protesters went on the rampage, torching police vehicles, petrol pumps, metro stations and tyres. A source in the Interior Ministry said strict orders have been issued to lthe aw enforcement agencies not to open fire on any protester. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi ordered blackout of TV channels. The authorities have also blocked access to Twitter and Facebook. Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) has banned live coverage of Faizabad operation.

" ISMAILIA: Egypt on Saturday said an attack on a mosque by militants in the country's troubled region of northern Sinai has killed 305 worshippers, including 27 children, a dramatic increase in the death toll previously announced, which was 235. A statement by the country's chief prosecutor, Nabil Sadeq, said the attack on Friday left another 128 people wounded. It said the attackers, estimated at between 25 and 30, arrived at the mosque close to the small town of Bir al-Abd in five all-terrain vehicles and positioned themselves at the main door and the facility's 12 windows before opening fire. They also torched seven cars parked outside the mosque, which belonged to worshippers inside. Quoting testimonies given to investigators by survivors, the statement said some of the attackers were masked. Those who were not sported heavy beards and long hair. The militants wore camouflaged pants and black T-shirts, it added. Also on Saturday, Egyptian warplanes were in action over Sinai, according to the military, targeting several vehicles in which some of the culprits of the attack were traveling. All passengers of the vehicles were killed, it added. It was impossible to independently verify the claim since the media is virtually banned from working in Sinai. The chief prosecutor's statement was the most detailed by authorities on the attack, the deadliest by Islamic extremists in Egypt's modern history. The account it gave generally agreed with what witnesses told The Associated Press on Saturday in the Suez Canal city of Ismailia, where some of the wounded are hospitalized. They spoke of horrific scenes during the approximately 20 minutes it took the militants to kill and maim worshippers. They spoke of some jumping out of windows, a stampede in a corridor leading to the washrooms and of children screaming in horror. Some spoke of their narrow escape from a certain death, others of families that lost all or most of their male members.

" On an average a woman in Uttar Pradesh will live twelve years lesser than in Kerala. This is one of the many glaring findings of the India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative report published in top medical journal Lancet on Tuesday. For the first time ever, India has released numbers of state-wise burden of diseases tracking trends over the past thirty years which highlights disparities between states. National-level data can obscure disparities across Indias varied landscape, so a detailed understanding of health challenges at the state level is necessary to ensure that policies are responsive to the specific context of each state, it says. While Assam, Uttar Pradesh and Chattisgarh have the highest disease burden rates, while Kerala and Goa have the lowest rates. For example, in Assam, men live close to three years lesser than the national average at 63.6 years while in Kerala they live over seven years more at 73.8 years. In Uttar Pradesh, average life expectancy of females in 2016 is 66.8 years, close to four years lesser than the national average of 70.3 years, while in Kerala it is eight years more than the national average at 78.7 years, it states. Life expectancy in whole of India has improved over three decades but is still lower by eleven years than in China and Sri Lanka, said Lalit Dandona, Director, India State-Level Disease Burden Initiative. For India is a double-whammy of non-communicable diseases increasing across states, with states of Punjab and Tamil Nadu have the highest disease burden due to diabetes, while on the other hand states like Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha are tackling highest disease burden due to infections because of unsafe water, shoddy sanitation and non-practice of hand washing, leading to deaths due to diarrhoea especially in children under five years of age. Taking a potshot at the Swacch Bharat Abhiyan, the report states that situation of unsafe water and sanitation is improving but not enough yet. The sweeping increase of the burden due to this combination of risks in every part of the country indicates emphatically that major efforts need to be put in place to control their impact in every state before the situation gets totally out of control, the report warns. Until this date, the report states that risk of malnutrition is unacceptably high. After thirty years it remains the single largest risk factor for disease in India. Around 15 per cent of total disease burden in India is child and maternal malnutrition. It is higher in states of Bihar, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh , Rajasthan and Assam and is higher in females than males. Per person disease burden is 12 times more than in China and the lowest burden is that of Kerala, but even that is 2.7 times higher than China. The report warns, It is a situation after decades of nutritional interventions in the country and must be rectified as one of the highest priorities for health improvement in India. Five per cent of total disease burden is due to unsafe water and sanitation and causes diarrhoea. It states, The improvement in exposure to this risk from 1990 to 2016 was least in the Empowered Action Group states, indicating that higher focus is needed in these states for more rapid improvements. Remarkably, the per person disease burden due to unsafe water and sanitation was 40 times higher in India than in China in 2016. While household air pollution is improving the outdoor air pollution is worsening, the report further says. The burden due to outdoor air pollution is highest in a mix of northern states, including Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, Bihar, and West Bengal. Kerala, Goa, Tamilnadu have lowest rates. The contribution of air pollution to disease burden remained high in India between 1990 and 2016, with levels of exposure among the highest in the world, it says. India has 72 per cent more per capita disease burden than China and Sri Lanka. Much remains to be done, said Dandona. Six times more children under-5 die in India than in Sri Lanka. We have four times more Tuberculosis and three times more iron deficiency anaemia than countries which have same socio-demographic factors. This is document desired by us and respective state governments for a very long time. It is a crucial and timely report. To this date, lower respiratory tract infections, Tuberculosis, Diarrhoea and Anaemia remains high along with burden of suicides and road injuries, said Anupriya Patel, Minister of State for Health and Family Welfare. While in states like Kerala the transition from dominance of infectious diseases to non-communicable diseases began as long ago as 1995, in some states like Chattisgarh the transition has occurred only about two years ago, almost twenty years later, said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, Secretary, Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). Numbers matter Estimated deaths due to communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases - Empowered Action Group (EAG) states - 34.6% North-east states - 32.1% Other states - 20.2% Estimated deaths due to non-communicable diseases - Empowered Action Group (EAG) states - 55.1% North-east states - 58.8% Other states - 68.5% (EAG states include Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Rajasthan, Uttaranchal and Uttar Pradesh) States with worse disease burden - Ischemic Heart Disease - Haryana, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka High Blood Pressure - Punjab, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal High Blood Sugar - Punjab, Tamilnadu Malnutrition - Bihar Unsafe Water, Sanitation, Handwashing - Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha Ambient Air Pollution - Haryana, Uttar Pradesh Diarrhoea Diseases - Jharkhand Lower Respiratory Tract Infections - Rajasthan Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder - Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Uttarakhand Road injuries - Uttarakhand, Haryana, Punjab, Jammu and Kashmir ","It is a crucial and timely report.

" Stanford scientists have identified a molecule that can be targeted to cure leukemia - the most common form of cancer in childhood. The therapy is similar to but distinct from CD19-targeted chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy, or CAR T-cell therapy, in which a patient's T cells are genetically modified to target a molecule called CD19 on the surface of the cancer cells. This therapy was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of some types of blood cancers, according to a study published in the journal Nature Medicine. The therapy genetically modifies a patient's T cells to target a different molecule called CD22, scientists at the Stanford University in the US said. The approach is helpful because the cancer cells of some patients who undergo CD19-targeted CAR T-cell therapy stop expressing the CD19 molecule on their cell surfaces. CAR T-cell therapy relies on a patient's own T cells - a type of immune cell that can be a powerful killing machine. Fifteen of the 21 patients in the study had previously either relapsed or failed to respond to anti-CD19 CAR T-cell treatment. At the lowest dose level, one in six patients achieved complete remission after treatment with the anti-CD22 CAR T cells. However, when the researchers escalated the dose to the next level in the study, 11 of 15 patients, or 73 per cent, entered remission. They hope that targeting CD19 and CD22 simultaneously may result in a powerful therapy - one that cancer cells are unable to evade.

" Amid growing allegations by Opposition parties that the Trinamool Congress-led West Bengal government is trying to suppress figures of death due to dengue, Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) served a notice to former Indian cricket team captain Sourav Ganguly on Friday over mosquito breeding spots. KMC officials carried out an inspection at Ganguly's residence and found mosquito breeding spots and larvae in his backyard and other inaccessible portions of his house. KMC officials reached his residence on Friday and warned him with a notice to carry out dengue prevention drives. This inspection by KMC officials came in the wake of Ganguly's elder brother Snehasish, a former Ranji Trophy player, being diagnosed with dengue. He was rushed to the hospital on November 23. Currently, Snehasish is undergoing treatment at a city hospital and doctors have confirmed that his health is improving. This is not the first time that Ganguly was warned of getting rid of mosquito breeding grounds said member, mayor-in-council, KMC, Atin Ghosh. ""We had found larvae of dengue mosquitoes at Ganguly's residence in Behala during our first inspection that was carried out on November 19, and had asked them to keep the place clean,"" Ghosh said adding, ""But, on second inspection on November 23, KMC officials found that the situation remained same. Hence, as per rules applicable to all, we served a notice to him. In fact, we spoke to Ganguly and he has agreed to provide us support. Our KMC officials will carry out fumigation inside his residence."" This apart, while hearing a PIL, the Calcutta High Court came down heavily on the Bengal government. When the Advocate General Kishore Dutta representing the government remarked that the petition was politically motivated as one of the petitioners was Pradesh Congress President and Lok Sabha MP, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, Justice Arijit Banerjee of the division bench said, ""Whether it is politically motivated or not, you can't deny that dengue is social issue. We do not want to blame anybody. It is a social problem hence I am asking what steps have you taken?"" Another petitioner of the PIL, Bikas Ranjan Bhattacharya said, ""The government does not want to admit that people are dying due to dengue. Hence an unofficial diktat has been issued to government hospitals to not mention the cause of death as dengue and all of them are stating 'unknown fever' as a cause of death. We have requested the court to constitute an expert committee of doctors to advise the government."" The division bench comprising the acting chief Justice Jyotirmoy Bhattacharya and Justice Arijit Banerjee will again hear the same matter on next Friday. Meanwhile, the state government continues to face flak from the opposition parties like Congress, Left and the BJP. Opposition parties have been alleging that the Trinamool Congress-led government is trying to suppress facts relating to dengue deaths. However, state officials say that it is an attempt to malign the government as a lot of people are dying due to 'unknown fever' but it is being said that they are dying due to dengue. According to the state health department, there have been 24 dengue deaths in West Bengal since January though the unofficial figure stands close to 50.

" Washington: Tiny microRNA molecules in saliva may help diagnose and predict the duration of concussions in children, according to a study. Concussions usually occur after a blow to the head - for example, during sports or a car accident. They can result in such symptoms as headache, nausea, confusion, amnesia or lack of consciousness. Researchers measured the levels of microRNAs - tiny snippets of non coding RNA - in the saliva of concussion patients. They found that the presence of certain microRNAs in saliva was able to better identify concussions and more accurately predict the length of concussion symptoms than relying solely on patient surveys. Steven Hicks from the Pennsylvania State University in the US said the findings, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, could result in a more fact-based way to diagnose and treat concussion patients. ""There's been a big push recently to find more objective markers that a concussion has occurred, instead of relying simply on patient surveys,"" Hicks said. ""Previous research has focused on proteins, but this approach is limited because proteins have a hard time crossing the blood-brain barrier. What's novel about this study is we looked at microRNAs instead of proteins, and we decided to look in saliva rather than blood,"" he said. While most concussions clear up within two weeks, about one-third of patients will experience symptoms longer. Patients are usually advised to rest and stay away from such physical activity as sports or gym class until their symptoms subside. Hicks said that while it is important to give the brain enough time to heal, it is difficult to accurately predict how long patients should rest. The researchers followed 52 concussion patients between the ages of 7 and 21 for the study. Each participant was evaluated using the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT-3) - a common tool that doctors use to inventory concussion symptoms and severity - within two weeks of their injury. The researchers also asked the patients' parents for their observations about their children's symptoms. In the study, they also collected saliva from each participant and analysed for levels of different microRNAs. They then compared the microRNA profiles to the patient's symptoms at both the initial and follow-up assessments. The researchers isolated five microRNAs that could accurately identify the participants who would experience prolonged symptoms. These microRNAs could correctly identify if a participant would have prolonged symptoms or not. ""The microRNAs were able to predict whether symptoms would last beyond four weeks with about 85 percent accuracy,"" Hicks said. ""In comparison, using the SCAT-3 report of symptoms alone is about 64 per cent accurate. If you just go off the parent's report of symptoms, it goes down to the mid-50s. In this pilot study, these molecular signatures are outperforming survey tools,"" he said ","Researchers measured the levels of microRNAs - tiny snippets of non coding RNA - in the saliva of concussion patients.

" KOLKATA: Former cricketer Sourav Ganguly's brother is in hospital with dengue, so is CPI(M) legislator Sujan Chakraborty. Dengue deaths are reported everyday in local news. A Border Security Force jawan died a few days ago at an outpost in West Bengal. But even today, the West Bengal government told the Calcutta High Court that the number of deaths due to dengue this year till 15 November is 23. Last Friday too, the state said the number of deaths was 23 when the high court was hearing eight petitions or PILs on dengue. But a petitioner put the state in a spot when his lawyer produced four death certificates from state hospitals stating dengue as the cause, names inexplicably missing from the state list. On Friday, the Advocate General said only one of the four cases was dengue. The court did not hide its disquiet. A division bench of Acting Chief Justice J Bhattacharya and Justice Arijit Banerjee said dengue is occurring every year despite the state's claim it was adhering to central government and World Health Organisation guidelines for its control. ""This shows that more steps need to be taken as these seem to be inadequate to control the disease in West Bengal,"" the bench observed. To a plea by the state Advocate General Kishore Dutta that petitions were based on newspaper reports only and not independent research, the bench said, ""Writ petitioners would not have had to come to the court if you on your own conducted research for further steps to deal with the issue."" ""We want to satisfy our judicial conscience that sufficient steps are being taken,"" the bench said when the AG questioned maintainability of the petitions. The advocate did not say which of the four unaccounted dengue deaths was genuine. NDTV met the family of one of the four -- Suman Dey, 35, who died on November 12 at the state-run Calcutta Medical College Hospital. His certificate of death clearly says he died of dengue. By every government yardstick, Mr Dey is a dengue victim. But his family is not surprised his name was missing from the state's list on dengue deaths. ""Clearly, there is some lapse. Doctors must be under government pressure. Because, after Suman died, a nurse told us they won't write dengue as cause of death. If they did, the nurse said they could lose their job. But I said I will not remove the body if you don't write the truth,"" said Krishnapada Dey, Mr Suman's brother-in-law. The state also gave the court a list of 22 people who died in private hospitals of dengue, according to those clinics. The state will not add that number to its list of dengue deaths till it verifies the cause at its own laboratories. The state government last updated the number of dengue deaths on the Union Health Ministry's website on October 4, which showed total deaths as 19. The Directorate of National Vector Borne Disease Control Programme, under the Health Ministry, works for prevention and control of vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. The lawyer-petitioner duo who traced the four death certificates in the government list have alleged that the state is trying to ""supress facts"". ""There is clearly an attempt to suppress facts. The documents the state submitted to court are not accurate. The death certificates we submitted prove they are false,"" said lawyer Subhashish Chakraborty. ""Not saying the state is causing dengue. But why is the state so secretive? Is it trying to hide its failure to follow WHO guidelines to prevent dengue?"" he added. Deborshi Chakraborty, a research scholar who accessed some of the controversial death certificates, said, ""More people are coming forward with death certificates that prove discrepancy between fact and fiction."" Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, who is also West Bengal Health Minister, has not given a statement on dengue deaths for weeks. Health officials who are familiar with the matter say they cannot comment since the court is hearing the petitions. Though the opposition has been protesting in the state assembly for two days now, the Trinamool Congress government has not responded to them. ","""Not saying the state is causing dengue.

" Pregnant and breastfeeding women who travel to places with high risk of diseases like malaria and yellow fever are less likely than other women travelers to be protected by vaccines and drugs, recent US research suggests. Lack of information about the safety of some preventive medications and vaccines during pregnancy and breastfeeding may be one reason some patients and doctors avoid them, the study team writes in Obstetrics & Gynecology. (There is) a tremendous lack of research in pregnant and breastfeeding women especially related to medication usage and vaccinations, said Diane L. Spatz of the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing in Philadelphia, who wasnt involved in the study. The research team, Stefan H. F. Hagmann of the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Childrens Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park and his colleagues, analyzed patient information from Global TravEpiNet, a consortium of US travel clinics that collects data on clinic users planning international travel. Travel clinics typically specialize in providing advice, immunizations and preventive medications that are needed or recommended for specific foreign destinations. Other sources, such as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), also post travel advisories about disease outbreaks and recommend destination-specific measures. Pregnant women are more susceptible to certain infectious diseases, including malaria and influenza, and in some cases experience more severe symptoms, the study team writes. Hagmanns team compared data on 170 pregnant women,139 breastfeeding women and 1,545 non-pregnant/lactating women who received pre-travel care at 24 Global TravEpiNet member clinics between 2009 and 2014. They found that most pregnant and breastfeeding women intended to travel to tropical destinations where mosquito-borne illnesses such as malaria, dengue, or yellow fever are normally present; and up to one third of pregnant travelers traveled to areas in the Americas, which, since the study was conducted, have experienced chikungunya and Zika virus epidemics. Most pregnant and breastfeeding women seen during northern hemisphere flu season had been vaccinated against the flu or received a shot during their clinic visit. Typhoid and hepatitis A were the most commonly administered vaccines to the pregnant and breastfeeding women during clinic visits. Still, these women were about half as likely as nonpregnant, nonbreastfeeding women to get these vaccines during their visit. Among travelers to countries where malaria is present year-round, about 50 percent of pregnant or breastfeeding women received preventive medications, compared to 73 percent of non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding women. Despite risky travel destinations, in some cases vaccines and drugs were declined by travelers, or withheld by healthcare practitioners, the study authors note, likely due to limited research on the risks of using certain vaccines, such as those for typhoid and yellow fever, as well as antimicrobial medications, during pregnancy. I was not really surprised by any of the studys findings, Spatz said. I am not confident that most women seek specific travel health care before traveling and their primary health care providers may or may not speak to them about these issues. Overall, pregnant travelers underused vaccines for typhoid, a potentially life-threatening and increasingly multidrug resistant illness, and hepatitis A, a common infection in poorer countries. Pregnant and breastfeeding travelers also received fewer provisional prescriptions than the comparison group for standby antibiotics to treat diarrhea. Hagmann did not respond to a request for comments, but the study team acknowledges limitations in its report, notably that the women seen in Global TravEpiNet clinics may not represent all pregnant or breastfeeding women travelers. There must be increased awareness among providers and travelers of the fact that travel advisories exist, said Dr. Diana E. Ramos of the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles, who wasnt involved in the study. We need to encourage the public to proactively do research on their risk, and if pregnant, the risk to their fetus, if they travel, Ramos said in an email.

" Love munching into the fries and chips? Cant stop noshing even if they have been sitting out in the open for a few hours? Well, you may want to rethink the idea, as the disease-carrying potential of flies sitting on the food could be much greater than previously thought. According to a latest study published in journal Scientific Reports, the microbiomes of 116 houseflies and blowflies from three different continents carried hundreds of different species of bacteria, many of which could bring about a bevy of diseases for humans. Considering their close proximity to humans, scientists have often suspected their role in carrying and spreading diseases and turns out that their part in spreading diseases in human beings is much more intimate and wide spread than previously thought. The researchers are optimistic that their study may help public health officials realise the extent of threat caused by pathogen transmission. Flies may contribute to the rapid transmission of pathogens in outbreak situations, noted researchers For the study, the researchers investigated the microbial content of individual fly body parts, including legs and wings. They discovered that legs transfer most of the microbial organisms from one surface to another. The researchers further noted that Blowflies and houseflies, both carrion fly species, they are also the most exposed to unhygienic matter because they use feces and decaying organic matter to nurture their offsprings, in these filthy places they could pick up bacteria that could act as pathogens to humans, plants and animals.Surprisingly, flies collected from stables carried fewer pathogens than those collected from urban environments, noted the study. The team also discovered almost 15 instances of the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori, a pathogen often causing ulcers in the human gut, in the blowfly samples collected in Brazil. Until now, flies have not been considered as a potential route of transmission of this severe disease. The researchers also posed a possibility of these flies causing more damage when more people are around. For instance, eating potato salad that been sitting out in your picnic is a far more risky affair in the urban settlement as it may land the entire group with severe gastric infections. It might be better to have that picnic in the woods, far away from urban environments, than in a central park, suggested the researchers. The reserachers used advanced genomic and computational methods to come up with results. They also feel that flies can be used for human benefit too. For instance they can be serving as living drones that can act as an early-warning system for diseases.

" Dengue fever continues to be a public health nuisance for India. We are losing innocent lives to this condition at an alarming rate. The only way to control the spread of this epidemic is to curb the mosquito menace and restrict a number of people getting infected by this virus through this pest. But we are hopeful that other means of controlling deaths due to dengue might emerge soon. One of the proposed preventive measures is vaccination. There wasnt a vaccination in place to prevent dengue till date. Here are 10 steps for speedy recovery from dengue. But some media reports have suggested that the pharma giant Panacea Biotec, has secured permission to do clinical trials in India in 2018 to test for the vitality of the vaccination for dengue they are coming up with. The permission was granted by Drug Controller General of India. The clinical trials are said to start in 2018 and the vaccine will be available mostly by end 2019. The mosquito-borne disease affects the platelet counts erodes immunity and causes deaths. This is why a vaccination can be of great help to lessen the number of deaths happening every year. Here are 10 practical tips to be mosquito free and fight dengue. Panacea Biotec, in collaboration with the National Institutes of Health (NIH), US, has developed the advanced dengue vaccine which promises safety and abides by the rules of preclinical studies. It is said that the single-dose shot vaccine has been found to stimulate a strong immune response against all four types of viruses in all age groups. While we are eagerly waiting for a vaccination to come to the fore, in 2014 a group of scientists and researchers had expressed certain concerns about the dengue vaccination. Scientists have warned that dengue vaccines could cause short-term but major spikes in the years after they are first used. Jan Medlock, an assistant professor at Oregon State University said that their analysis suggested that if they developed and widely used a vaccine for dengue fever, there might later be spikes in the incidence of the disease that were two to three times higher than its normal level. The research was done by experts at the OSU College of Veterinary Medicine and Clemson University, both of which supported the studies. Scientists used mathematical modelling to examine the quirks of infectious disease transmission that may lead to this quandary. According to the researchers, the beginning of a vaccination program would slow the numbers of children getting the disease, for a while. But its expected that a dengue vaccine would not provide total protection against infection. However, it was a 2014 report, we are keeping our fingers crossed thinking that things will better now and the new experimental drug will be able to tide off these shortcomings. According to the media reports if things go as planned for the media giant then probably with the introduction of the vaccination dengue deaths can be controlled by 2019.

" Shock and anger swept the country on Monday when it emerged that the parents of seven-year-old girl Adya, who died of dengue at Gurugram's Fortis hospital, were billed Rs 16 lakh for 15 days of treatment. The bill also included the costs of over a thousand gloves and 660 syringes. The father alleged that the hospital even refused an ambulance after her death, and went on to charge for the gown on her body. As the media flashed images of the cherubic child, the family also alleged that it was made to purchase the costliest brands of medicines. As the Central government was writing to states on Thursday to warn them of action for such cases, reports poured in that Gurugram's Medanta Hospital billed an insurance agent Rs 15.88 lakh for his seven-year-old son's 22-day dengue treatment. The father said he mortgaged his house to pay the bill but did not have money for further treatment. He shifted his son, Saurya Pratap, to the Central government's Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital in Delhi where the child died on Wednesday. The two cases have brought the spotlight back to private hospitals who milk families in a country where millions continue to grapple with a crumbling and corrupt public healthcare system. As if losing a loved one is not enough, every item even hand sanitisers, hair oil or wet wipes is charged most exorbitantly by private hospitals. A 14-year fight Octogenarian BR Saini recounts his 14-year struggle to seek justice for his eldest son, who died due to the alleged medical negligence of Lions Hospital & Research Centre in South Delhi's New Friends Colony. On November 19, 2001, Trilok Nath (37) was admitted to the hospital. He had been complaining of a headache for five months and had vomiting bouts 10 days prior to the admission. He had been brought from state-run GB Pant Hospital. A former Pant surgeon was heading the neurosurgery at Lions. A brain surgery was conducted on November 20. Trilok's condition worsened. He became drowsy, and slipped into a coma. Five days later, he died. A resident of West Delhi's Najafgarh, Saini had been billed approximately Rs 1 lakh. He had no insurance cover. Dr Brahm Prakash, who performed the operation, was insured for professional risks if a botch up is proved, the insurance agency will pay for the doctor. And records show that the hospital had botched up the case. An expert medical opinion was sought from RML Hospital, which said, ""The surgery was uneventful. The patient was conscious and oriented, and obeyed verbal commands in the immediate post-op period. Vitals were normal. However, in the evening, the patient became drowsy. At the first sign of deterioration, an immediate NCCT (Non-Contrast Computerised Tomography) of the head should have been done for an appropriate management, which was not done in this case."" Saini moved the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission in 2003. He spent thousands of rupees and made numerous visits to the Commission. In 2017, the Commission asked the hospital to pay Rs 24,56,000. The judgement says, the hospital conducted neurosurgery without CT scan/NCCT facilities. In response to an RTI application filed by Saini, RML Hospital confirmed, ""A neurosurgical centre should have all the required facilities, including CT scan, for diagnosing as well as follow-up."" ""The hospital has now moved the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. A fresh battle has started. I am not sure if I will live to see justice,"" rues Saini, a former Central government employee, who has submerged himself in papers despite his poor health. 'What EWS quota? Pay Rs 10 lakh' While Saini has been fighting a losing battle, the healthcare scene in India is plummeting. ""National Sample Survey findings show a decline in the share of public hospitals treating patients,"" says Denny John, a Delhi-based health economist. In India, 64.21 per cent of patients end up paying through their nose at private facilities because government systems fail them at each step, as is the case with 49-year-old Mandawali resident Subhash Chand. On the night of October 19, he met with a road accident. The police took him to two government centres and finally admitted him to Max Hospital in Saket. Less than a week ago, Max discharged him because bills soared to Rs 10 lakh in a month. Items such as gloves, tubes and syringes alone cost over Rs 1 lakh. Drugs, lab tests meant another Rs 1.5 lakh; the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) rent was Rs 1.76 lakh. And then there were ambulance, blood bank, surgery, physiotherapy, radio diagnosis and consultation charges. Chand, who is a driver, earns Rs 8,000 a month but has a family of four to feed. He was certified an ""Economically Weaker Section (EWS) member by Delhi Health Minister Satyendra Jain's office. ""We asked for free treatment mandated under a Delhi High Court order but the hospital refused,"" says his wife, Rama. Chand had suffered extensive brain damage, is in a semi-conscious state and does not recognise anyone. Now at Bal Kishan Memorial Hospital, he has a feed tube in his mouth and an air pipe in the throat. ""The hospital made me sign an undertaking that I must pay the bill otherwise legal proceedings would be initiated. Should I take care of him or fight the system?"" Rama asks. DNA's questions to Max Hospital remained unanswered. Unending court battle Dwarka resident and former Delhi University professor KC Malhotra (83) is a man with slow movements but a strong voice. He has spent a decade seeking justice for his dead wife. Krishna was admitted to Escorts Heart Institute & Research Centre in 2006, and diagnosed with diabetes and coronary artery disease, for which she was operated upon. Soon, she developed a diabetic foot and the hospital amputated her left leg up to the thigh. This led to a total handicap, as the veins from the right leg had been removed for a bypass surgery. Malhotra filed a complaint in 2008 at the Delhi State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission. She died in 2010. He paid a bill of Rs 4 lakh. After seven years, the Commission has held the hospital guilty of medical negligence and asked it to pay Rs 20 lakh in damages to Malhotra, and Rs 75,00,000 to a consumer welfare fund. The case is in the High Court now. ""So many years and I am still running around at this age. At 83, a man breaks down, but this is for my wife and I will fight till the end. As of now, there has been no conclusive decision but I am hopeful,"" says Malhotra. Complaints abound At least three private hospitals BL Kapoor, Rockland and Gupta Multi-speciality Hospital in Delhi have been indefinitely barred from providing services under the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) after complaints were received against them. In 2016-17, 143 complaints were received across India against CGHS-empanelled private hospitals for denying admissions and cashless facilities, inflated bills and medical negligence. The CGHS was started under the Union Health Ministry to provide comprehensive medical care to Central government employees, pensioners and their dependents at fixed subsidised rates at empanelled private hospitals. Of the 1,114 private hospitals, diagnostic centres and clinics empanelled with CGHS, 300 are in Delhi. ""So many pensioners complain that they did not get beds, they were forced to take loans or sell their property. They are overbilled or are discharged against their wishes. Often the hospital staff have been rude to them,"" CGHS director Dr DC Joshi tells DNA. In December 2016, a CGHS beneficiary patient died in an empanelled hospital in Kanpur. ""A death certificate was issued and his details were updated in our records. A month later, we received a fraudulent bill raised by the hospital in his name. Private hospitals don't even spare the dead for their greed,"" he says. This, despite Rs 600 crore being disbursed towards settling bills of private hospitals since April 2017. This is exactly what happened in Adya's case. Fortis hospital procured 21 vials of the costlier brand of Meropenem injection Merocrit by Cipla, per vial priced at approximately Rs 3,100 billed at Rs 65,362, and 9 vials of cheaper brand of the same Meropenem injection Merolan by Mylan, per vial costing approximately Rs 500 billed at Rs 4,491. ""Both the brands were pumped into my baby's body. Clearly, more vials of the expensive injection, up to seven times the price but said to have the same effect, were administered. We were not even asked our preference for drugs which is an essential right of the citizen,"" Jayant Singh, deceased's father told DNA. Centre cracks the whip The Health Ministry has asked the Haryana government to launch an urgent inquiry and submit an action taken report in Adya's case and written to all states to implement the provisions of the Clinical Establishments (Registration and Regulation) Act under which effective action can be taken against healthcare establishments for fraudulent and unethical practices. The Centre has advised that lessons be learnt from widespread cases and a meeting with all important healthcare establishments, including private hospitals, of each state be held, and they be clearly warned against any such practices, failing which strict action will be taken. The government has said exorbitant charges, deficiencies in service, violation of standard treatment protocols resulting not only in compromised patient safety but also concerns about transparency and accountability in healthcare costs have an extremely deleterious impact on the faith of general public of the country. ""It is our duty to ensure that such incidents don't recur, quality care and treatment is provided to persons in need and that it is provided at a fair and affordable price,"" a ministry letter has told states. ","As the Central government was writing to states on Thursday to warn them of action for such cases, reports poured in that Gurugram's Medanta Hospital billed an insurance agent Rs 15.88 lakh for his seven-year-old son's 22-day dengue treatment.

" England keeper-batsman Jos Buttler has been signed up by Sydney Thunder for the forthcoming seventh season of the Big Bash League. The 27-year-old joins Callum Ferguson and New Zealand's Mitchell McClenaghan as the side's new recruits for the season. Buttler, a dynamic T20 batsman capable of scoring all around the ground, will be available for the first six games of Thunder's season before he joins the national side for England's limited-overs assignment against Australia. The Englishman was excited by the prospect of interacting with Australia great Michael Hussey, who is currently serving as Director of Cricket at the club. ""I'm delighted to be part of Thunder and get stuck in, Mike Hussey is someone I've really admired and I'm really excited to meet him,"" Buttler said. ""Eoin Morgan is a good friend, he had two seasons with the club and he spoke really highly of everyone and said I'd have a brilliant time. I'm excited to get stuck in and make some friendships. One of the great things about these tournaments is meeting new players and learning from guys and creating friendships all over the world."" The England international, who played five BBL games for the Melbourne Renegades in the third season, is eager to get reacquainted with the Australian fans. ""I'm really excited. I've played in the BBL once before, ahead of England's last ODI tour to Australia,"" said Buttler. I've watched the competition go from strength to strength to become one of the best competitions in the world. The crowds are fantastic and there's a big family emphasis which creates a great atmosphere."" The decision to sign Buttler despite his partial availability stemmed from his ability to create impact from anywhere in the batting order. Despite being a middle-order batsman, Buttler enjoyed success batting at the top for Mumbai Indians in IPL 2017. It is this kind of flexibility that makes Buttler a hot-property in the T20 market, according to Hussey. ""He's a quality player who provides us with plenty of flexibility. He can bat at the top of the order like he does for the Mumbai Indians and also in the middle order. We've done a lot of homework and asked around and all the feedback we've heard is that he's a fantastic character that will add a lot to the dressing room. ""We know we're going to lose him for the second half of the season but we have a strategy in place for that. I feel that we're well placed to start the tournament well and its important to get a few wins on the board early as it can get pretty close late on."" The seventh season of BBL starts on December 19 with the Thunder hosting cross-town rivals Sydney Sixers in the tournament opener. ","""I'm delighted to be part of Thunder and get stuck in, Mike Hussey is someone I've really admired and I'm really excited to meet him,"" Buttler said.

" On Friday afternoon, Anurag Thakur, former BCCI president, tweeted about womens cricket in North East. U-19 Womens Cricket 136 Wides (94 by Manipur Vs 42 by Nagaland), Low Score 2 (1 on wide ball) runs by Nagaland. He then sent out a bigger-picture tweet out: Giving full voting rights to each state w/out structured development of cricketing standards will harm the game. Cricket in northeast needs nurturing not humiliation like this. #LodhaReforms @BCCI This was in reference to Fridays U-19 womens one-day game where Nagaland scored 2 runs from 17 overs and nine of their batters got out for duck. Kerala won by scoring 5/0 in 0.1 overs. Back in Imphal, Priayananda Singam, secretary of Manipur Cricket Association (MCA), isnt convinced. Why do we need one-state one-vote? It will allow us to play in more tournaments, bring much-needed funds to develop cricket in infrastructure, and give us a voice in way cricket is run. How can anyone link a one-off performance to voting? That too without knowing the background story. The girls played serious cricket sometime last decade. We are trying to revive it now. In the first week of October, during the U-17 football world cup, The Indian Express visited Imphal to get a sense of football mania as the tiny state had sent eight players to the Indian squad. In a corner of football town, cricket was still trying its best to breathe. MCA had just a month to prepare for girls tournament there wasnt time, there wasnt a team yet, but there was dream in the air. In their minds, it was start of the revival of girls cricket performance wasnt the goal but an event to kickstart interest. 7.30 am in Imphal. Singam keeps looking at the rusty gate of Luwangpokpa ground. Wild grass has mushroomed all around not a surprise considering heavy rains had almost blown away the national highway to Dimapur. Singam is waiting for the girls to come for practice. They didnt even have a team then. They were hunting for girls to form one when Singam had a brain wave. Why not try to lure hockey and boxing players to start playing cricket? I went to the hockey matches, and tried to spot and talk to girls who might be interested in playing cricket. However, there was a problem. How do you spot talent? Well, goalkeeper to start with! Then you just go with your feel, and ask around. I tell them, if you play hockey, you have to go by road or train, if you do well in cricket, we can take you in flight in the future. And so, the curiosity peeked as the girls started to troop in that October morning the hockey girls, boxing girls and some who play cricket. A coach takes them into the arena, and gives a lengthy pep-talk, and tells them some basic rules of the game. Then the action begins. They are lined up in a queue the coach hits the ball out, and the girls run, pick up, turn and throw. Some managed to ping the gloves, others threw it far out, some didnt have the strength to bridge the distance. Patiently, the coach continued to explain how to throw, how to line-up the arms, and how to take aim. Inside, in a dusty long warehouse like room, a paper is stuck on the wall at the far end. Vertical lines run across a circle, inside which is nestled a small circle with a centered dot. For aim, a girl says. This is where they learn to bowl. Work in progress The ground is itself unkempt as the work to construct a few rooms for offices for cricket association was about to begin. The state government had pitched in with the funds to build a few rooms, and the work is expected to be done by December. And episodes like wides and all-out for 2, Singam fears, will recur if they dont get a voice in cricket in the country. We dont get to play tournaments. Our Manipur boys team is good- we win in the North East tournaments. But we play few and far between. How will we ever improve? The boys get to play in U-16 and U-23 tournaments. For u-19, the six states in North East, and Bihar, combine to form one team. Thats it. No other representative cricket. The fear is what will happen to Manipur men if they play Ranji Trophy. Wont more humiliation await them? A idea we have proposed to BCCI is that to have a tier-structured. At the bottom group, if we can get all the North East teams and Bihar to play first-class, and perhaps the best or two teams can then be elevated to something like Plate league? Cant a nation where cricket is so mad, invest in our youth? There are 5 active districts who play cricket, and about couple of dozen clubs associated with the association. Without funds, though, not much local cricket is organised. Its MCA who tries to conduct cricket. We have to re-organise our district cricket. We have five A-level coaches, and 9 O-level coaches. The plans are ambitious, though. In Manipur, where sports offer a way out for kids, Singam reckons he can crack the cricket puzzle. We plan to have school-academies, where education can be subsidised and the young kids can be developed. For that we need funds, of course. Last time BCCI gave us money was 50 lakhs in 2009. Nothing after that. What if they dont get one-state one-vote, but are supported with funds and infrastructural help? How do you think thats going to happen? We would be exactly where we are now. Thats the state of affairs now without recognition, and with some token help, how would cricket flourish here? Whats the guarantee that things will improve? ","For that we need funds, of course.

" Chennai: Chennaiyin FC's resounding win over NorthEast United here in their Indian Super League match was marred by the heckling and mocking of a visiting side fan by a home supporter which was strongly condemned by both the team owners. Videos of a man, who is seemingly a supporter of Chennaiyin FC, making curious gestures towards a female NEUFC supporter were posted on Twitter, which drew condemnation. Chennaiyin FC, who had emerged 3-0 victory in the match last night, has condemned the alleged ""unbecoming behaviour"" by a section of their fans against a group of North-East United FC fans during the ISL game at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium and said the club will take strong action. ""Chennaiyin FC has a very strict and firm policy against racism and any unbecoming behaviour in the stadium. The club strongly condemns any such act. We are looking into any such incidents and will take strong action against it,"" Chennaiyin said in their official Twitter handle. NorthEast United owner, Bollywood actor John Abraham too slammed the incident and said the team stood by the fan who was ""victimised"". ""It's deeply disturbing to me when sports become an unsafe or unharmonious place for anyone. Everything I have taken back from sport has been only positive, from learning to play with people who are different, learning to take loss with a sense of sportsmanship, winning with humility,"" Abraham said. ""To the girl who was victimized by these insensitive and thoughtless people, 'we stand with you and you will never feel alone you must've felt at that moment. I will personally meet you and make sure you are OK."" ""To the 'fans' who troubled her, I'll call you fake fans because I know that Abhishek or myself would never condone this behaviour from our own true fans.

" New Delhi: The 11th edition of the I-League, Indias premier footballing tournament, is set to begin on Saturday and unlike previous seasons, it will not have the crme de la crme of Indias currents footballers. Most, if not all of the national team players under Stephen Constantine ply their trade in the more lucrative Indian Super League, in effect opening an avenue for more home grown talent to step up to the plate. The 10 team competition spreads out across quite a considerable amount of the country in terms of geographical area. From Minerva FC in the north, to Imphal in the east with Neroca alongside defending champions Aizawl FC, to Gokulam FC in Gods own country Kerala and last but not the least Churchill Brothers in Goa. Even though Maharashtra doesnt feature in the scheme of things the spread has more than enough variety. Over the last couple of years thanks to the FIFA U-17 World Cup, there has been a lot of talk about the importance of having a strong grass root system or good bench strength to fall back on. Co-incidental or not, the All India Football Federations honchos brought their heads together and decided that given the situation it would be best to blood Indias U-17 World Cup squad along with some U-19 players into the next edition of the I-League the reason cited was development. Feel the I-League will be good exposure in terms of match experience and temperament to prepare for the future. Former India footballer Shyam Thapa was quoted saying earlier in the year. A full developmental squad in the top flight, just like the time of the Palian Arrows earlier in the decade, this time though the AIFF is seemingly more confident of financial backing. Far away from the Arrows, one of the teams most affected by the Indian Super League being the pick for the premier national players has been Mohun Bagan. The Green and Maroon brigade have taken a blow in all departments of the playing field goalkeeper Debjit Majumdar moved to ATK, Anas Edathodika went to Jamshedpur, Pritam Kotal moved to the national capital with the Delhi Dynmos, Pronay Halder is in FC Goa, while the likes of Kean Lewis, Sehnaj Singh, Souvik Chakraborty, Jeje Lalpekhlua and Balwant Singh all found other franchises in the ISL. The blow that was below the belt was Katsumi Yusa, the captain, joining their staunchest arch rivals East Bengal. Bereft of the star power manager Sanjoy Sen had to rebuild along with and around the talismanic Sony Norde. I enjoy working with younger players. Before the Mohun Bagan man joined the I-League he worked with the Indian youth teams alongside Colin Toal from 2007-2010. Sen adds that between the two legacy clubs it is difficult to get a chance to work with younger players but he is more than happy in doing so. He points out, It is my duty as a coach to ensure my players are motivated and ready for the season. The young players need to step up and take the chance. As the coach of a club where there is always the pressure of the tag and history, I hope I get to see many young talents come through the system, he adds. Sen though is not unduly worried about banking on youngsters as the likes of Chesterpaul Lyngdoh, Azharuddin Mallick, Debabrata Roy, Abhishek Das Naro Hari Shrestha, Gurjinder Kumar and Ricky Lallawmawma to name a few, made a good start with the Calcutta Football League. It is important to treat the talented players well and groom them. It is also important to promote and market the competition well, Sen quipped and further added, This is the first time I am attending a big opening to the season like this. More of this will only help. Clearly, the man who helped Mohun Bagan back to the top in 2015 after more than a decade was interested in investing in youth. Across the Kolkata Maidan, East Bengals wait for the title has been more painful. Captain Arnab Mondal shoots back when the topic is raised. A year ago, Mehtab Hossain promised to leave the club if he didnt bring back the title co-incidentally he turns out for Jamshedpur FC in the ISL. Mondal and Khalid Jamil the coach though will have to deal with much lesser numbers in terms of the young crop as they have managed to sign some of the best Indian names outside the top brass. The likes of Brandon Vanlalremdika, Laldanmawia Ralte, Salam Ranjan Singh, VP Suhair and Mehtab Singh are the newer lot they were all part of a squad the saw the Red and Gold bring home a record 39th Calcutta Football League crown earlier this year. That was Khalid Jamils first tournament with the squad, and all of the Indian football fraternity would agree he is well acquainted with working on limitations. His title winning Aizawls overall budget wasnt a patch on the either of the Maidans big two. Mondal explains, This is a platform for newer and younger players to come to the forefront. This is a very good opportunity for the boys in the Arrows team also. More than anything, the players, if they want to make something out of this chance they need to be responsible and act accordingly, he reasons. Considering the young guns listen to the captains message East Bengal would definitely be in the contention for silverware come summer of 2018. Speaking of silverware, defending champions Aizawl FCs dream team has been majorly hit by the transfer window. Once coach Jamil moved on, the likes of Jayesh Rane, Albino Gomes, Mahmoud Al Amna and Ashutosh Mehta also found new teams. The four alongside Alfred Kemah Jaryan helped form the very core of the championship winning team, with Al Amna being instrumental without an iota of doubt. On field mentors now, Alfred and captain Shylo Malsawmtluanga, will have to blend their experience with a squad brimming with young talented and gritty players if they are to pull of anything of the same magnitude retaining a title is amongst the most daunting tasks in football. The young keeper Lalremruata Arema may not have excelled yet in the Mizoram Premier League, but William Lalnunfela who knows a thing or two about high pressure situations will have to up the ante. Lalrinzuala Khiangte, William Lalnunfela, Liandala Sena and Jonathan Lalrawngbawla are among the other who will fight it out as they aim to squeeze their way into Stephen Constantines squad. The Portuguese coach Paulo Menzes Coelho is likely to have a cruel initiation to management in the top tier. Indias champions or Indias Leicester City as they had been nicknamed after their best season ever have not done well so far in the Mizoram Premier League but a change in momentum can come about as quickly as turning a corner. The core of the team from last time has moved on, but this is our chance to rebuild an exciting team. The fans are very intense and they deserve it, Paulo says. We are the champions, and we will be difficult to beat in the season. Especially at home, asserts the tactician, who was part of Spains Golden Eras coaching entourage led by Vicente del Bosque. Last season, the young men Nim Dorjee Tamang and Isaac Vanmalsawma shone for Shillong Lajong, while Jerry Mawihmingthanga and Lallianzuala Chhangte were the brightest spots for the DSK Shivajians team. Minerva FC threw in their fair share and more of young blood into the mix. Their owner is strongly of the opinion that it is better to invest in home grown talent over foreigners, even if it is mostly because it aids his budgetary concerns. Add to this the fact that since taking over in his second stint as manager of the Indian national team, Stephen Constantine in his two years has handed more than a whopping 30 players their senior team debuts. The Englishman has always been extremely vocal about his support and the need for a strong bench. It is not likely that Indian football will find their next Sunil Chhetri or Gurpreet Singh Sandhu this season, but unlike the previous years, it will be easier to make a noise.

" Hockey India on Saturday named 33 players for the Indian womens national camp to begin in Sports Authority of India, Bengaluru from November 26. The players will report to Indian womens hockey teams chief coach Harendra Singh and will train together till December 23. The womens team recently created history by winning the Asia Cup 2017 after beating China in the final. Their exuberant performance not only won them the qualification for womens World Cup to be played in London next year but it also helped them climb up the FIH World Ranking to a commendable 10th position. 2018 is a very crucial year for Indian hockey. Through our performance in Asia Cup we climbed the world ranking but Commonwealth Games, Asian Games and World Cup are big tournaments and our training is focused on doing well in these events, chief coach Harendra said. The teams aim will be to finish on the podium in at least the Commonwealth Games or the Asian Games. Our aim is to finish in the final of the Commonwealth Games and also qualify for the 2020 Olympics by winning the Asian Games. The coaching staff has identified the teams shortcomings during Asia Cup and we will work on improving in those areas. Another important aspect will be improving our speed and strength during this month-long camp. We will also be testing a few junior players and see how they keep up with the demands of senior womens hockey, Harendra said.

" London: Chelsea manager Antonio Conte is wary of former Blues forward Mohamed Salah as he insisted a heavy travel schedule could be no excuse for a sub-standard performance against Liverpool at Anfield on Saturday. The Egyptian has made a big splash since returning to the Premier League from Serie A club Roma in the summer, scoring nine goals to lead the scoring charts. ""Salah is a good player and is very dangerous,"" said Conte in Friday's pre-match press conference. ""He is a technical player, but at the same time is very fast, very strong, very good in one v one."" File image of Chelsea manager Antonio Conte. Reuters File image of Chelsea manager Antonio Conte. Reuters Salah joined Chelsea in January 2014 but the Egypt international was soon loaned out to Fiorentina and Roma, moving to the Italian capital club on a permanent basis before signing for Liverpool in the pre-season. Victory for Liverpool would see them draw level on 25 points with Chelsea, currently third in the table, and Conte is well aware of the threat posed by Salah. ""He's very good to finish. We must pay great attention, but not only to Salah, also to (Sadio) Mane, (Roberto) Firmino, Philippe Coutinho, (Daniel) Sturridge. ""They have a good coach (Jurgen Klopp), they have a good identity. Great organisation, especially offensively. They are very dangerous."" The Italian was reluctant to discuss why the Liverpool hot-shot had left Chelsea given the 25-year-old Salah's exit pre-dated his arrival at Stamford Bridge but said: ""He was very young and I think he developed a lot."" Chelsea beat Azerbaijan's Qarabag 4-0 on Wednesday to qualify from Champions League Group C and returned to London on Thursday after a 2,500-mile flight from Baku. Conte has complained repeatedly about the scheduling of this weekend's fixture given Chelsea have had a shorter recovery period than Liverpool, who drew 3-3 away to Spanish side Sevilla in the Champions League on Tuesday after squandering a 3-0 half-time lead. Chelsea's journey was further complicated when strong winds at Gatwick Airport, south of London, meant the plane needed two attempts to land, with Conte and his squad not getting to bed until about 6:00am (0600 GMT). ""To get to your house at 6:00am is not simple,"" he said. ""To have only one day to prepare a big game, especially to have only one day to rest, is not right. ""But at the same time we must be focused on the game, a big game against Liverpool. Don't find excuses."" Chelsea will be going in search of a fifth straight league win as they aim to reduce a gap to leaders Manchester City that presently stands at nine points. They will kick-off with a familiar-looking Conte on the bench after he shaved off the beard he sported during the international break, deciding he would rather follow the advice of his daughter Vittoria than that of his wife Elisabetta, who had encouraged him to grow it. ""I wanted to try a new look, but yesterday my daughter killed me. She said to me 'Daddy, your look is older with the beard',"" Conte said. ""My daughter is more important than my wife.""

" Mahendra Singh Dhoni, when leading the Indian cricket team, was referred to as 'Captain Cool'. Dhoni's calm demeanor, especially during tense moments, right through his career has been a hallmark of his personality. Dhoni's teammate and friend Suresh Raina, however, has now said that the former India captain was not as cool as he appeared on the television screen. ""There is no emotion in his eyes. Despite not wearing sunglasses, you cannot figure it out. We will be like 'come on, man. show us some reaction',"" said the southpaw on the Breakfast With Champions show. ""But he does get angry, you don't see it. The cameras don't pick it up. But as soon as the telecast cuts to the ads, he will say 'Tu sudhar jaa (Get your act together)',"" Raina added. Raina, who played a lot of his cricket under Dhoni for India and Chennai Super Kings, applauded him for his leadership skills. He (Dhoni) is a very good leader. He knows whats going to happen next. He keeps Plan A, Plan B, Plan C ready for every situation. He carries all of them during the play. He strategises the things a night before and executes according to the situation, Raina said. Raina and Dhoni enjoyed a great run together in the IPL. However, their reunion for the 2018 season seems unlikely. The teams are likely to be allowed to retain two Indians and one overseas player. According to several media reports, the CSK want to retain MS Dhoni, Ravichandran Ashwin and Faf du Plessis. Considering star left-hander Suresh Raina's record playing for Chennai, several fans were not exactly pleased after these reports surfaced.

" Barcelona: Lionel Messi ended months of speculation when finally putting pen to paper on Saturday to extend his contract with Barcelona until 2021, the club announced, making official an agreement reached in July. The Spanish giants had announced in the summer that Messi, 30, had committed his future to the club but the Argentine had not signed the new deal. With his previous contract set to expire in 2018, Messi could have left Barca for free next summer had he not extended his deal. ""FC Barcelona and Lionel Messi signed on Saturday morning a new contract that will keep the Argentinian superstar at the club through the 2020/21 season,"" read a club statement. ""The buyout clause was set at 700 million euros ($835 million)."" The steep rise in the five-time World Player of the Year`s buyout clause from 300 million euros in his previous contract is designed to avoid any repeat of Paris Saint-Germain`s capture of Neymar from Barcelona by paying the Brazilian`s 222 million euro buyout clause in August. Pressure has been mounting on beleaguered Barca president Josep Maria Bartomeu to get Messi to put pen to paper. Bartomeu was heavily criticised for his role in Neymar`s departure and a haphazard search for replacements in the final weeks of the transfer window. However, Bartomeu saw off a vote of no confidence measure launched by disgruntled fans thanks to Barca`s fantastic start to the season, in large part inspired by Messi`s form. And Bartomeu now has the image he craved of a smiling Messi tying the remainder of his peak years to the club. Messi`s 30 trophies are along with teammate Andres Iniesta the most in Barca`s history, including eight La Liga and four Champions League titles. The diminutive Argentine, who joined Barca at the age of 13, has also smashed 523 goals in 602 games to become the Catalans` all-time top goalscorer. News of Messi`s renewal also comes as a huge boost to the La Liga leaders ahead of Sunday`s top of the table clash at Valencia (1945GMT). Barca lead a revitalised Valencia by four points, with both Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid a further six points adrift, thanks to a club record start of 11 wins and one draw from 12 games.

" Opener Murali Vijay added to the selection conundrum with a patient 128 and was ably complemented by 'Run Machine' Cheteshwar Pujara's unbeaten 121 as India grinded a mediocre Sri Lankan attack on the second day of the second cricket Test, on Saturday. Pujara and Vijay added 209 runs for the second wicket to set a platform from where India would look to bat the islanders out of the contest. Ending the day at a comfortable 312 for two, the hosts are 107 runs ahead of Sri Lanka's first innings total of 205. Playing his first Test match after eight months, Vijay increased the 'happy headache' of the team management as they will be spoilt for choice during the third Test match in Delhi and more importantly, the Test series in South Africa. With his compact technique, the Tamil Nadu opener is certainly going to have a headstart over his nearest rivals --- KL Rahul and Shikhar Dhawan, when the team embarks on the tour to South Africa. Pujara, who scored his 14th century has skipper Virat Kohli (54 bating) for company. Kohli is looking good for a big one on the third day and surely would be playing a more attacking role than Pujara, who took 246 balls to reach his century. With the pitch not offering any assistance to the bowlers, Sri Lankan attack looked pedestrian as the seasoned Indian duo scored runs easily without taking any undue risks. The Pujara-Vijay combination has been a nemesis for bowlers in the Indian sub-continent with their 10th century stand in longest version. Vijay hit 11 boundaries and a six off 221 deliveries before being dismissed while trying to sweep Rangana Herath. Pujara batted through the whole day facing 284 balls in which he hit 13 boundaries. Three more satisfying pieces of statistics is sure to bring smile in the Indian dressing room. Vijay-Pujara pair score at an average of 73 runs per partnership - highest among all Indian pairs across Test cricket and Saurashtra right-hander has completed 1000 Test runs in 2017. Pujara-Vijay were also involved in their fourth successive century stand. Vijay teed off with a glorious square drive off Eden Test hero Suranga Lakmal (0/58), who was far from his best with conditions not aiding his kind of bowling. For someone who plays the drive fluently, Vijay was time and again provided with loose half-volleys both outside the off-stump and on his legs for him to make full use. The shot with which Vijay brought up his half-century was a picture perfect straight drive off Dasun Shanaka. There was a lot of time at India's disposal and that's why the batsmen were in no hurry yet comfortably got their runs. The home team scored at a steady if not breakneck pace but always had control of the proceedings with the three seasons yielding - 301 runs in 90 overs. The acceleration in the final session was largely due to skipper Kohli's flurry of strokes - he hit six boundaries facing 70 balls. Dinesh Chandimal's decision to bring in his spinners hardly yielded any different result as both looked comfortable reaching to the pitch of the deliveries nullifying any help that they could have possibly got off the pitch. When Herath (1/45) flighted one inviting Pujara to come out, he promptly did so by flicking it to the vacant mid-wicket boundary. His straight drive off Lakmal was regal as he hit nine fours having faced 183 deliveries. Vijay on his part gave Herath the charge hitting him for a straight six. He completed his hundred with a push towards long-off of Dilruwan Perera's bowling. He achieved the landmark in 187 deliveries. Dilruwan (0/117 in 21 overs) could hardly turn a single delivery and was the weaklink of the attack leaking runs from one end. Worse, he was stationed at short mid-on for a specific uppish drive. Vijay did fall into the trap trying to flick Lahiru Gamage and the ball flew towards Dilruwan, who couldn't pouch onto the catch. The Tamil Nadu opener was batting on 61 then. There wasn't a single wicket-taking delivery from the Lankan attack as they could hardly beat the bat. With no lateral movement on offer and the pitch offering reasonable good bounce and carry, strokeplay became relatively easier. The fuller length deliveries did not seem to work for them while the trio of Lakmal, Shanaka (0/43 in 13 overs) and Gamage (1/47 in 22 overs) did not have enough pace to trouble the batsmen when they hit back of the length. On a pitch like this and a toothless attack, Pujara would have always proved to be a handful as he batted with effortless ease. It seemed like he treated the Lankan attack like any other domestic team. There wasn't even a single delivery that could breach Pujara's defence.

" Fast bowler Stuart Broad thinks the tourists are ""the best placed England side for 30 years"" after three enthralling days at the Gabba. England bowled Australia out for 328 - a lead of 26 for the hosts - despite a quite brilliant hundred from Australian captain Steve Smith who made an unbeaten 141. In a tricky spell before the close, England lost two wickets but had retaken the lead and importantly still have Joe Root at the crease. It sets up the fourth day nicely with all three results still possible although Australia are probably slightly ahead given the pitch looks to be getting better, not worse, for batting. ""I've left every day's play of this Test match, not knowing who's ahead,"" said Broad after the day's play. ""I think days three and four will be the best days to bat on this pitch. That's good signs for us. It's in our hands. ""If we have a couple of batsmen tomorrow apply themselves, play with some great patience we can build a really good score to put Australia under pressure the last day. We are in a lot of control of this game after three days. It's in our hands tomorrow to get above 250-300."" England started the day excellently, taking three Australian wickets in the first session to reduce the home side to 209-7 before a partnership of 66 between Smith and Pat Cummins wrestled the initiative back towards Australia. ""I think we had a fantastic morning, stuck to some brilliant plans and then the new ball worked for us,"" said Broad. ""I really do think it's a new ball pitch. Once the ball gets 20 overs old, the pitch gets quite slow, quite hard to force a mistake out of the batsmen. Today, we saw a lot less spin. Maybe the moisture had come out of the pitch slightly and I think that will continue into tomorrow."" England's bowlers toiled with plenty of discipline on a slow pitch - although their pace was notably down from the day before - and Broad, who finished with 3-49, and James Anderson (2-50) both conceded less than two runs an over. ""We bowled a huge amount of cutters today,"" said Broad. ""Without the ball seaming or swinging, we decided to get the ball moving with rolling our fingers across the ball. ""When your fingers are coming either side of the ball, it's not going to have the same pace as when your fingers are right behind the ball. On pitches like this, you've got to subtly mix your pace a lot because batsmen who are patient, it's quite hard to get them out."" Although Anderson appeared to hold his side at one point during the morning session and only bowled three overs with the second new ball, Broad, who admitted it was a plan for the fast-bowlers to bowl short spells, played down any injury concerns. ""I don't know where this mystery injury has come from. He's just bowled 30 overs. I spent the whole day with him and he's not moaned about anything or said he's injured."" Broad said Smith played ""brilliantly"" but also praised England's bowlers for how they frustrated Australia's captain. Smith's innings spanned 326 deliveries, a strike rate of less than 44, nearly 13 runs less than his overall strike rate in Test cricket. ""He played with a lot of patience, was very disciplined around his off-stump,"" Broad said. ""But also, credit to our bowling attack because it must have been one of the slowest hundreds he's scored. We didn't let them get away from us at any stage."" England deployed a number of innovative fields and set six men on the leg-side in a variety of positions during the morning session when they bowled a litany of bouncers at Smith. Generally though, England bowled outside off-stump throughout Smith's innings. ""He doesn't seem to get out LBW or bowled too much,"" said Broad. ""We've looked at his dismissals in Australia in the past four years and there's one bowled when he was on 170 trying to hit it out of the ground and a couple of LBW when it was reversing. ""A lot of the best batsmen in the world don't miss straight balls so it's the outside edge that's his biggest threat. He was incredibly patient but if we get a pitch with any sideways movement and a bit more pace, it brings the edge into play. ""Rooty's captained the first three days well but it was probably the three weeks before that that set up the clear plans. Shane Bond has been absolutely awesome with the plans that the guys have come up with. We wanted to go in to the Test series with quite clear plans. ""If a batsman got to 30, what would we do. How would we start to each batsman. There's actually not too much think on the feet out there because we've done the research. A lot of the plans worked fantastically well. Any time you bowl Australia out in Australia for just over 300, you're taking that every day of the week."" England had to ensure a torrid spell of fast bowling from Australia for an hour before the close. They lost Alastair Cook and James Vince cheaply but ended the day on 33-2 with Joe Root and Mark Stoneman still there despite both taking nasty blows. ""You can so easily lose four or five wickets and that's the Test match gone,"" Broad said of England's performance with the bat. ""They're wonderful times to bowl, you're fresh, you can charge in. You can't really lose anything in that hour. ""Obviously, a bit disappointed to lose two wickets but it could have been a lot worse. It was proper Test match cricket. Tomorrow will be slightly different. We've got to set up to bowl 90 overs tomorrow, make their bowlers bowl 20 overs each and then it's harder to bowl that way.""

" Google India on Wednesday paid homage to Rukhmabai, one among the first Indian women to practice medicine in colonial India, with a doodle. Todays Doodle by illustrator Shreya Gupta shows the courageous doctor among her patients, doing the dedicated work of a skilled physician, said Googles blog post on its doodles. But Rukhmabai has another feather in her cap. If women in modern India can assert their rights of consent, it is due to Rukhmabai refusing to recognise her marriage and the case filed by her husband thereafter. Born on this day in 1864 in Bombay, Rukhmabai was the only daughter of Janardhan Pandurang and Jayantibai. She lost her father when she was eight years old and was married off at the age of 11 to Dadaji Bhikaji. Her mother later married Sakharam Arjun, an eminent physician and the founding member of Bombay Natural History Society. Rukhmabai continued to stay with her mother and step-father even after marriage. Seven years later, Dadaji moved court seeking it to order his wife to live with him. Rukhmabai refused to move in with her husband stating that a woman cannot be compelled to stay in a wedlock when she is not interested. Her decision was supported by her step-father who helped her fight the case in court. The Dadaji vs. Rukhmabai case that went on for three years triggered a debate in both England and India. The verdict went in favour of Dadaji. The court ordered Rukhmabai to live with her husband or face six months imprisonment. A brave Rukhmabai said she was willing to opt the latter. The verdict was subsequently overruled by Queen Victoria. This prompted the government to bring the Age of Consent Act, 1891, despite opposition from conservative Indians. Rukhmabai legally separated from her husband in 1888 and moved to England to study medicine. She got support from Dr. Edith Pechey of Bombays Cama Hospital, activists, and fellow Indians in England to complete her course in the London School of Medicine for Women. She returned to India in 1894 and practised in Surat, Rajkot, and Bombay for the next 35 years. She passed away on September 25, 1955. Incidentally, Google has created two more doodles today. Users in Russia will be seeing a slideshow depicting the life and times of writer Vladimir Dal, who compiled the Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language.

" Swimming with wild dolphins is something most can only dream of, and jumping into pools with captive animals has become increasingly controversial with environmentalists condemning it as cruel. But a Dutch non-profit believes it has found a way to bring people, especially the disabled, closer to such a joyful experience through the technological, immersive advances offered by virtual reality (VR). The Dolphin Swim Club is the realisation of a more than two-decade journey by artist Marijke Sjollema, who had her first chance encounter with a dolphin in 1993 while snorkelling off the coast of Mexico. I saw this grey shadow under the water and my first thought was this is the end. I thought it was a shark, she said. Ms. Sjollema tried to stay calm but this shadow was following me. And then there was this split second that I realised that it wasnt a shark. It was a dolphin. How it all began I didnt know anything about dolphins, but I instinctively knew, Oh a dolphin, Im fine. This is a good thing. From that moment on, Ms. Sjollemas love of dolphins and all cetaceans was born. We know that there is something magical about dolphins. We think of joy, and playfulness and happiness and innocence when we meet dolphins. And this is even a healing quality, Ms. Sjollema said. Ms. Sjollema and her business consultant husband, Benno Brada, have devoted their spare time, energy and personal resources to their mission of enabling people to discover their own encounter with dolphins. Healing qualities Their first project using normal virtual reality headsets playing a film of the dolphins launched in late 2015. However, last month, the couple went a step further, unveiling waterproof virtual reality glasses, which allow people to drift around a pool watching bottlenose and spinner dolphins playing around them in virtual reality. This virtual reality dolphin therapy in a pool, still at the trial stage, is thought to be a world first. The dream was to find an alternative to dolphin-assisted therapies using dolphins in captivity, Mr. Brada told therapists at a residential community for disabled people run by the S Heeren Loo organisation who were testing out the waterproof goggles in the pool. The centre has been using the land version of the VR glasses since 2016, and has seen noticeable benefits. Some 82% of our clients feel actually relaxed by seeing the films, said the organisations policy advisor Johan Elbers. It takes them away from the world they are in, they enter a new world in another mindset, think differently, feel differently, see differently, and relax completely. Then you are zen He recalled how one young woman, who had long had trouble sleeping, now watches a VR film of the dolphins swimming at night, and falls quietly asleep. Another man is able to completely forget an agonising pain in his arm. Dion, a 21-year-old resident of the community, said watching the film made him feel peaceful. The dolphin noises and the water calms me down, that calms me from all the noises that there are, then youre zen, he said. ","It was a dolphin. And this is even a healing quality, Ms. Sjollema said.

" Its November 22, 2028 and Sarah, a young mother, gives her two children a kiss goodbye before buckling them into the driverless car that will bring them to school. Sarah doesnt have a car and has no plans to buy one. Living in a suburb, she has run the numbers and the result is clear: Its much cheaper to order a car only when she needs one. The robo-taxi has also made her life easier, but only after such vehicles upended the business models which carmakers had relied on for decades. Such a future may not be far off. The revolution is already underway, with every major brand racing to create autonomous electric cars and trucks that will always be just a few clicks of a smartphone away. Fully electric cars are expected to make up 12% of the global market in 2025, before jumping to 34% in 2030 and 90% by 2050, analysts at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch forecast last month. The motivations are clear: Smog is becoming a serious menace in cities around the world, with China in particular demanding cleaner vehicles for its rapidly growing market. Nimble rivals Traffic jams are also eating up hours of commuters time, meaning car ownership is already no longer a given for many city dwellers. And carmakers have nimble new rivals: Apple, Google and Tesla, which last week unveiled an all-electric semi truck, see a chance to dominate a market that will soon depend as much on software as on engineering. Industry chiefs arent waiting: Frances PSA is betting on car-sharing and other services with its Free2Move division. In Germany, Daimler is working with Bosch to develop self-driving electric cars that could be on the road by the early 2020s, and has already launched its own car-sharing service, Car2Go, in some two dozen cities worldwide. Its German rival Volkswagen has created Moia, a social movement unit exploring e-shuttles, ride pooling and car hailing. Even if in the future not everyone is going to own a car, with Moia were trying to make sure everyone will be a client of ours one way or another, VWs chief Matthias Mueller said. Robo-taxis could generate 40% of auto industry profits by 2030, according to German consulting firm Roland Berger, which expects demand for private vehicles to drop 30% in the period. And industry experts warn that the automakers which fail to adapt to the shift risk might not survive. But that means investing billions in batteries, charging infrastructure and autonomous driving technologies with little prospect of seeing a pay off any time soon. VW announced on Friday a plan to spend 34 billion ($40 billion) over the next five years on hybrid and electric cars and services in a bid to reinvent the automobile. But for now, so-called zero emission vehicles remain a tough sell: Renaults Zoe range of electric cars, which it has offered since 2012, made up just 1% of its sales last year.

" A new Xiaomi phone render has surfaced online with a full-screen 18:9 aspect ratio display. One might expect it to be some kind of successor of the Mi Mix series but, the photo clearly shows bezels (however minute) on all four sides of the phone. So then what is this device? Speculations are leaning more towards the device being Xiaomi's yet-unannounced Redmi Note 5, which according to earlier reports, is coming with a bezel-less display. However, the apparent dual-front camera system on the front of the phone throws a twist in the tale. According to Gizmochina the phone could most likely be the Xiaomi Mi 6C. Now there is no way to verify this information so it is all guess-work at the moment. The back side of the phone's render does not show the top of the device where we the the dual-camera system and the fingerprint sensor may be residing. Also visible in the renders is what looks like metal body and speaker grills at the bottom, which according to the report, is quite reminiscent of a mid-range Redmi device. The report also claims that the phone could be priced around CNY 1,499. No further details are available at this point. Xiaomi tweeted out on its Indian Twitter handle that it will be launching a new phone in India on 30 November. The tagline for this new device is #Deshkasmartphone and it might be possible that the company will be launching a smartphone that is completely built in India as it gears up to boost its manufacturing presence in India.

" Indian two-wheeler giant Hero MotoCorp unveiled an adventure motorcycle concept titled Xpulse at EICMA show in Milan in the first week of this month. The concept model is regarded as the spiritual successor to the Impulse dual-purpose bike which the manufacturer launched In India six years ago. Though the company was coy about India launch of XPulse during its unveiling, emerging reports shed some light on the launch time frame. The XPulse has been developed at its Jaipur-based R&D centre, not only for India but also across for a number of its export markets. However, the home country will be the first to get the production version. A report in NDTV Auto claims Hero MotoCorp is planning to launch XPulse in India sometime by June, or July 2018. The report also claims Hero officials wanted to make the XPulse a mass market product. Hence, performance has been somewhat sacrificed keeping mind fuel efficiency concerns. The adventure bike is expected to draw power from a 200cc single-cylinder air-cooled engine which is currently under development for the upcoming XTreme 200S while the tuning will be different. This engine is likely to be tuned to churn out 18.5bhp at 8,500rpm and peak torque of 17.2Nm at 6,000rpm and will get two riding mode options - City and Sport. The motorcycle is rumoured to have a kerb weight of just 140 kg. That will make the vehicle certainly lightweight and more usable bike for new adventure biking enthusiast.

" Samsung is gearing up to announce the successors of this year's flagship phones aka Galaxy S9 and S9+ in forthcoming year. The South Korean smartphone manufacturer is reportedly preparing to show off these smartphones at CES 2018 and official launch them by March. However, there are no official words on the same. Ahead of the launch, Samsung's Galaxy S9 lineup has been subjected to several leaks and rumours -- some suggests it may come with the same Galaxy S8-like infinity display, while other rumours hint at a much improved camera, hardware and software set-up. However, as the company prepares to unveil the Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+, there are some reports which claim that these phones will have even slimmer bezels than the Galaxy S8, S8+. Rumour has it that the Galaxy S9 could have a screen-to-body ratio that could touch 90 per cent. Report of the Galaxy S9's display comes via SamMobile, which says that Samsung is looking to narrow the bezels even further with next year's flagships. The Galaxy S9 could have a near non-existent bottom bezel, while the top bezel will be narrower than that seen on the Galaxy S8. Samsung will still need to keep some bezels on the forehead as it will house the front-facing camera, sensors and earpiece. If the rumour is true, the Galaxy S9 could have a screen-to-body ratio that is nearly 6 per cent more than that of the Galaxy S8+, which was at around 84 per cent. The latest rumour isn't surprising as major tech giants have been competing to bring smartphones with large edge-to-edge displays in a small form factor. The S9 with a 90 per cent screen-to-body ratio will look to blow away the likes of the iPhone X which comes with an 82 per cent screen-to-body ratio. 2018 will continue the bezel-less trend and companies will bring out smartphones that will chop down bezels even further to approach that truly full-screen design. The Galaxy S9 and Galaxy S9+ are expected to be teased at the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show in January 2018 before its actual launch in March. Based on the rumours so far, the upcoming flagships will continue to sport Super AMOLED Infinity displays, with the former getting a 5.8-inch panel and the latter getting a 6.2-inch panel. They are expected to be powered by the yet-to-be-announced Snapdragon 845 processor coupled with 4GB of RAM for the S9 and 6GB of RAM for the S9+. You can also expect an update to Samsung's iris scanning functionality as the company will look to take on Apple's Face ID feature on the iPhone X ","If the rumour is true, the Galaxy S9 could have a screen-to-body ratio that is nearly 6 per cent more than that of the Galaxy S8+, which was at around 84 per cent.

" While the tech world is celebrating Black Friday with huge discounts, OnePlus has no plans to move along with the masses. The Chinese company has even announced a GBP/ EUR/ USD 0.01 discount on the original price of the OnePlus 5T to counter the ongoing Black Friday deals. Nevertheless, the Dash Power Bundle that helps you rapidly charge your OnePlus smartphone has received a straight 50 percent discount for 24 hours starting Friday in Europe, the UK, and the US. ""Our goal is to share good technology with the world. That's why we price our devices fairly year-round, so that you don't have to double check the match. Say no to Black Friday price games,"" OnePlus said. To give an example of the discounts, the OnePlus 5T was launched in the UK with a starting price of GBP 449 that has been reduced to GBP 448.99 after receiving the ultra-nominal Black Friday discount. Similarly, if you look for its 128GB variant, it is priced at GBP 498.99 (originally priced at GBP 499) in the UK. Similar discounts are available in the US and some European regions. As for the Dash Power Bundle, it is now priced at GBP 14.59, compared to its original GBP 28.98 price.

" Amid rising investments and Bitcoin futures products, the cryptocurrency market cap has crossed $250 Bn. Besides Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Ethereum are two other cryptocurrencies that have shown remarkable growth this week. And, with every gain in Bitcoin Cash, the bloodbath between Bitcoin enthusiasts and Bitcoin Cash supporters gets real. Trading at $400, Bitcoin Gold is also set to jump into the ongoing war. Meanwhile, encashing the Bitcoin popularity and increasing price, one of the leading Indian payment gateway platforms Billdesk has launched cryptocurrency exchange Coinome. Inspired by the latest success as Bitcoin soars at $8,200, the US-based online retailer Overstocks CEO Patrick Byrne argues that Bitcoin is more powerful than physical, old-fashioned money. Patrick opines, Its about time the world switches to real money; either gold or bitcoin. While Patrick may have a point there as Bitcoin is traded in almost over 60 countries legally, it is important to note that cybercrimes surrounding cryptocurrency have grown exponentially too. From the Mt. Gox fiasco to Tether, this week, the list is quite long. bitcoin-price-ethereum-cryptocurrency-coinome Lets take a look at the recent developments from the world of Cryptocurrency! Billdesk Launches Coinome, A Cryptocurrency Exchange In India You Might Also Like: Billdesk-Backed Cryptocurrency Exchange Coinome Launches In India The 15 Cryptocurrency Exchanges In India That Are Bringing Bitcoin & Ethereum To Mainstream Cryptocurrency This Week: The Govt. Of India Maintains Status Quo, Bitcoin Gold Hard-fork, The Bubble Territory And More Not A Good Month For Bitcoin: RBI Looks Into Cryptocurrencies, But Still Uneasy About Bitcoin One of the leading Indian payment gateways Billdesk has recently launched a cryptocurrency exchange Coinome in India. The exchange currently offers the trading of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash and aims to add 20 cryptocurrencies by the end of 2018. Mumbai-based Coinome allows users to be onboarded via an instant e-KYC process. Under the process, a user needs to register his/her Aadhaar number, post which an OTP is sent for the verification and activation of the account. With Billdesk being the promoter of the exchange, Coinome will have an easy window to build trust and deal with cybersecurity threats, which are currently the key concerns of cryptocurrency exchanges across the world. Speaking to Inc42, Vivek Steve Francis, CEO of Coinome averred, Coinome is the first Cryptocurrency exchange to introduce e-KYC process using Aadhaar numbers. Unlike other major cryptocurrency exchanges, we have planned to introduce the trading of leading 20 cryptocurrencies by 2018. Malaysia To Regulate Cryptocurrency Malaysian Central Bank will announce a cryptocurrency regulation by early 2018, said its Governor, Tan Sri Muhammad Ibrahim. According to a Malaysian web daily Malay Mail Online, the Central Bank Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) will designate persons converting cryptocurrencies into fiat money as reporting institutions under the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act 2001 beginning next year. Speaking at the Third Counter-Terrorism Financing (CTF) Summit 2017, Tan stated, We need to prepare ourselves, as according to many pundits, digital currencies will become the new norm. The advent of digital currencies as some have forecast, will mark the beginning of a new era in the financial sector. As authorities, we cannot be oblivious to these developments.. Marking the fact that cryptocurrency has allegedly opened new doors for terrorists, Muhammad said that big data analytics and AI can play a big role to stop these criminal acts and the entire banking system must lead the way to minimise such risks. South Korea Will NOT Regulate Bitcoins South Korean Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) Governor Choe Heung-sik has said that FSS has no plans to supervise transactions in Bitcoins or other cryptocurrencies. According to Korea Times, the Korean government believes that digital tokens do not function as a payment tool and remain as subjects of speculation. Hence, the FSS does not recognise cryptocurrency trading as financial products or services. While having lunch with Korean reporters, Choe stated, It is the same with the fact that we dont regulate or supervise casinos. Though we are monitoring the practice of cryptocurrency trading, we dont have plans right now to directly supervise exchanges. Supervision will come only after the legal recognition of digital tokens as a legitimate currency. Swissquote Bank Launches Bitcoin Certificate In its attempt to minimise the risk and volatility of Bitcoin, Switzerlands leading online bank Swissquote Bank has launched an exchange-traded product called Bitcoin certificate. It allows mainstream investors to participate in cryptocurrency boom through a traditional financial vehicle publicly traded at six Swiss exchanges. By buying Bitcoin certificates at regulated exchanges, investors are less exposed to the risks associated with trading and holding actual Bitcoin themselves, but can still benefit from potential profits, reads the company statement. ADVERTISEMENT Peter Rosenstreich, Head of Market Strategy at Swissquote stated, Even though we believe that Bitcoin represents the future, the volatility can be very high and considered too much of a risk by the average investor. This is why our strategy focuses on reducing volatility by increasing the amount of cash in periods of uncertainties and downturns. With the certificate, the average investor gets a regulated and transparent gateway to Bitcoin, without needing a special Bitcoin wallet, managing public and private keys or having to fear theft or hacks. We expect that investors will be willing to accept slightly lower returns in exchange for better protection against downside risks, added Peter. AgreCoins To Be Launched On December 1 After Bitcoin, hard-forked coins, Bitcoin futures and Bitcoin certificates, aggregated crypto coins are set to launch in the market. Index fund-type coins Agre and UpStart1K (UP1K) will be launched through ICOs on December 1, this year. AgreCoin compiles the top six coins and makes them into their own fund, thus minimising the risk involved in buying single coins, while also benefitting from the gains of all six coins. The second coin UP1K will be aggregated based on the bottom 1000 coins. According to their whitepaper, the AgreCoin token contract will be based on the OpenZeppelin library. OpenZeppelin is an open-source framework to build secure smart contracts. Its meant to provide secure, tested and audited code to enable the new generation of distributed applications, protocols and organisations. Back in India, Coinome and other recent exchange launches reflect the public mood despite the RBIs discomfort. However, the frauds and hacks surrounding Bitcoins continue worldwide. Cryptocurrency startup Tether recently reported the theft of $31 Mn worth of cryptocurrencies. The wallet theft and Ponzi schemes can be tackled easily if people trading Bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies know everything about the blockchain technology and its intricacies. Aimed to educate people about crypto know-how and blockchain, author Brandon Zemp has launched his new book called The Satoshi Sequence: A Manifesto on Blockchain Technology. Besides the history and technology of Bitcoin, the book also provides tips on how to invest in cryptocurrencies.

" Mumbai: Promoters of steel companies undergoing resolution under the bankruptcy code were keen to bid for assets but will not be able to do so now after the amendments to the law, which will result in larger losses for banks, says a report. ""Promoters of most large steel companies were quite intent to regain control and did appear to offer the most competitive bid during the resolution process but are barred from doing so now,"" domestic brokerage Kotak Securities said in a report on Friday. The report comes a day after government promulgated an Ordinance amending the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code that bars promoters of companies which have defaulted for over a year from bidding for the assets being sold by the banks to reclaim their dues. ""Absence of promoter bids can potentially increase losses for banks during the recovery process as competition will lessen,"" the report said without quantifying it. Representational image. PTI Representational image. PTI It also said the policy is retrospective in nature and can hit businesses coping with down-cycles or unexpected policy changes, which would make the one-year period too onerous even for honest promoters. Stating that promoters of steel companies were keen to bid, it said the probability of a higher bid during the resolution process ""now needs to be tempered"". It said most of the initial dozen resolutions being carried out under the IBC provisions involve companies who have defaulted for over a year and hence, it is ""highly unlikely"" that promoters in any of these companies can bid for their assets. The day the Ordinance was issued, Rajnish Kumar, chairman of SBI, which tops the list of NPAs had said though he does not mind a haircut (to resolve the bad loan issue), that does not mean he wants to go bald"". But he was quick to defend the new law saying valuation of these assets won't be affected due to the promoters not bidding. The Ordinance aims at putting in place safeguards to prevent unscrupulous persons from misusing or vitiating the provisions of the IBC, the corporate affairs ministry had said, adding the amendments would be applicable to cases where the resolutions are yet to be approved. The amendments to the insolvency law need to be approved by Parliament in its next session beginning 15 December. The changes essentially mean that certain promoters would not be allowed to bid for their own assets under the insolvency proceedings initiated to recover overdue loans. In the first phase, as many as 12 companies with collectively owe Rs 2.5 trillion or a quarter of the total bad loan mess of Rs 10 trillion, are under bankruptcy resolution. These companies include Bhushan Steel, Essar Steel, Bhushan Power & Steel, Lanco Infratech, Monnet Ispat, Electrosteel and Amtek Auto among others were referred by the RBI for resolution under this law. In several of these cases, the original promoters themselves are among the bidders.

" New Delhi: Banks are improving their risk assessment systems with lessons learned from failed projects that they have financed, while the bankruptcy reforms have made them more confident in taking lending decisions, said Rajnish Kumar, chairman of State Bank of India (SBI). In an interview, Kumar said that concerns of political pressure on public sector banks in making lending decisions are overplayed. He said that bad loans choking Indias banking system are mostly because of assumptions about economic growth that have gone wrong. Kumar, who took the reins of SBI in October, spoke about the banks future growth strategy and key challenges confronting the banking sector. Edited excerpts from an interview: How equipped is SBI and the traditional banking system in India to take on the disruption caused by new age financial technology (fintech) companies? SBI is very well equipped. If you see our journey in the last couple of years, especially digital and technology, we have taken the lead. The entire programme of digital, technology and innovation in SBI revolves around four things: customer experience, cost efficiencies, superior risk management and employee satisfaction. As you embrace new technology, how are you tackling the threat of cyberattacks? For dealing with cybersecurity, awareness is essential. So there are programmes to make every employee aware of the threat. There is need for investment and a proactive approach for dealing with this menace. There are many instances of breaches, last years WannaCry is one such incident and it is a constant battle. You fortify, but still there will always be someone trying to breach it. There are systematic measures that organizations need to take. We have taken all those measures and there are periodic reviews. These reviews are by the top management and by specialists. How is SBI dealing with the decline in private investments in the Indian economy? We have the largest customer base from the most underprivileged segment to the highly privileged. Each segment has different needs. Fintech firms and start-ups are mostly in the payments space or are in small lending category. When it comes to the payments segment, SBI is the market leader with a 30% share, be it BHIM (a payment application), wallets or RTGS (quick online fund transfer system). We are very well entrenched in every segment and we are constantly upgrading. We are eager to tie up with new age companies as indicated by our partnerships with Snapdeal or Ola. One has to be proactive and learn new things. We are in talks with many fintech start-ups where we are open to following a partnership model. If someone has invested time, money and brain power and if the opportunity is suitable, we have no hesitation in joining hands. Are you seeing a revival in demand for credit from the private sector? There is recovery and it differs from sector to sector. But there is recovery in certain sectors such as roads, renewable energy. Im also very hopeful about railways, which needs huge investment and it has a multiplier effect. Policies in railways are also now very enabling. When investment happens in railways, apart from convenience to commuters, there will be need for engineering projects and that will help SMEs, there will also be job creation. Even increase in construction of roads and infrastructure projects leads to job creation. One sector that is seeing investor interest is steel. The capacity for steel production and demand has matched. As economic growth gains further momentum, it is only natural that the sector grows further. There have been allegations that there is political pressure to lend to certain businessmen and that has in the past led to bad loans. This issue about political pressure on lending decisions is overplayed. When credit is given there are certain processes and assumptions about a business. These assumptions could go wrong if economic conditions change. But any wrongdoing should be punished, be it banks, businessmen or those exerting outside pressure. The law should be allowed to take its own course. Banks are improving their risk assessment systems based on past experience. Do you think the latest changes in the bankruptcy code debarring errant promoters from proposing revival schemes will reduce the number of parties bidding for such companies? Bankruptcy code is a new system. It is a big reform and we have to make it a success. I believe there is a lot of investor interest in the assets that are undergoing insolvency proceedings. One has to see that there is a value in the enterprise. What are the changes that you are bringing in the way business is done by SBI? Each one in the bank is responsible to ensure that we provide the best service to customers. In addition to investing in technology, we are also imparting training to staff in providing better services to customers. Do you think the quest for efficiency and the use of technology in the banking sector will lead to redundancy in workforce? This was a concern that we had to deal with when we went for computerization in the 1980s. Would it have been possible to have such a developed banking sector without computerization? There is always some trade off. With deployment of technology, certain new sectors also emerge. Were there jobs in technology sector in the 80s? There is no way a business can reach out to the masses without technology. ","One has to see that there is a value in the enterprise.

" Finance Secretary Hasmukh Adhia said on Saturday that a decision regarding the formation of a National Anti profiteering Authority would be announced next week, amid reports of uneven rates of Goods and Services Tax (GST) being levied on the consumers. ""Maximum one week. We will constitute it within a week,"" Hasmukh Adhia told ANI. The recently-promoted Finance Secretary appealed that GST rate cut benefits be passed on to consumers, adding that companies should paste stickers of the revised rate of Maximum Retail Prices on their products at the immediate possible date. ""We request companies to pass on benefits to consumers immediately if you do not want the action of National Anti profiteering Authority (NAA),"" Adhia commented while appealing to the companies to immediately aware consumers of their rate cut of products by giving advertisement in newspapers. The Finance Secretary also said that the retailers or vendors must charge revised rates from consumers after November 15. ""We will catch companies if their vendor/retailers are not passing the rate cut benefits to consumers. We won't catch the retailers,"" added Adhia. Replying to the question about overcharging of restaurants, Adhia said that the government has no control over the rates of small restaurants. ""If small restaurant charge higher then practically they will lose their customers due to competition,"" he stated. ""Earlier restaurants charged more from customers stating that they are being charged under 18 percent GST. Now the customer at least knows that in their bill the government is charging only five percent,"" he said. The Finance Secretary also stated that the government will ask big restaurants chains about their rates. As far as big chain of restaurants is concerned, if they've uniformly raised prices, we'll ask them what their input tax credit was which they don't get now. If input tax credit mismatches with prices raised anti-profiteering action will be taken against them, Adhia added. On being asked about government's plans to reduce the number of slabs in Goods and Services Tax (GST), Adhia opined that "" GST should be simple, a number of slabs should be reduced. There is no difference of opinion on this. The question is how right it is to do so."" The GST Council at its 23rd meeting held on November 10, 2017, in Guwahati, had recommended the reduction of the GST rate from 28 to 18 percent on goods falling under 178 headings. Now only 50 items are under the GST slab rate of 28 percent. A large number of items have also witnessed a reduction in GST rates from 18 to 12 percent, 12 to 5 percent and so on.

" As electric mobility continues to slowly gather steam in India, Mahindra has reportedly announced that the company will be launching two electric vehicles for Indian markets by 2019. This announcement has come at a time when the Modi government is planning to go big on green mobility options in near future and is urging auto companies to fall in line with this agenda. According to a report by the NDTV Auto, the Indian car maker will introduce two electric cars in Indian auto market, which are likely to be based on existing cars models in the company's portfolio. ""Our first new electric car will come by 2018 and the second one will be launched by the end of 2019 and we are very excited for both,"" the report quoted Mahindra & Mahindra Managing Director Dr. Pawan Goenka. While Goenka did mention that the electric vehicles in offing will be Mahindra's current models with an electric power train, as per the report, but he did not disclose the models that will be re-launched in electric avatars. Mahindra's KUV100 seems to be a good option for getting a electric makeover owing to its small size and lighter body. Meanwhile, reports of Mahindra's popular full size SUVs Scorpios and XUV500 getting their own electric versions were also doing the rounds earlier this year in September. Mahindra Electric, the electric mobility arm of Mahindra was reportedly planning to invest Rs 300-400 crore in the venture. Notably, Mahindra is the only Indian car manufacturer to make electric passenger cars. The Mahindra Electric, formerly known was Mahindra Reva, presently markets e2o Plus and eVerito electric cars for private use, along with Supra minivan and e-Alfa Mini commercial EVs. The company has managed to sell around 600 electric cars by far in the current fiscal, as per reports. Mahindra and Mahindra only recently joined hands with Uber to help the cab aggregator deploy a fleet of hundreds of electric cars in Delhi and Hyderabad by March next year. The plan is to expand the initiative to other parts of the country in due time. Uber's India-based competitor Ola has announced to deploy 400 units of the electric version of famous Tata Nano, named Jayem Neo. Global players Suzuki and Toyota have already announced their plans to spearhead India's electric mobility programme.

" New Delhi: A clause in Indias global tender for steel rails, part of a $130 billion overhaul of its railways, could help Jindal Steel and Power Ltd win up to 20% of the work, officials with direct knowledge of the matter said. The worlds fourth-largest rail system is undergoing a five-year overhaul to replace ageing tracks, improve efficiency and end a spate of deadly train accidents, including one on Friday. State-run Steel Authority of India Ltd (Sail) has struggled to supply the steel, however, and is expected to deliver 920,000 tonnes of it this financial year, just 65% of its target. In response, the ministry of railways last month opened up a global tender for 717,000 tonnes of steel rail worth an estimated Rs3,000 crore ($464 million) to private bidders for the first time. Global steelmakers such as ArcelorMittal and Thyssenkrupp could bid, as could Jindal Steel and Power, Indias only private producer of the steel. Indias steel ministry has objected to the tender, pointing out that preference should be given to local suppliers in support of Prime Minister Narendra Modis drive to boost manufacturing. Indian railways officials have also expressed concern that JSPL lacks experience building rails, three people with knowledge of the conversations told Reuters this month. A senior railways official said any decision for the tender would depend on competitive bidding, which opens next month. Developmental clause However, Indian railways is considering using a clause in the 18 October tender that allows for a developmental or a trial order of up to 20% of the steel to be awarded to a domestic manufacturer, four officials with direct knowledge of the proposal said. It can award that work even if the bidder does not have proven performance of supply of rails, according to the tender. JSPL, which says it has supplied 150,000 tonnes of rail to Iran since 2016, did not respond to a request for immediate comment. The railways ministry is likely to make a decision within two weeks and is keen to award work to JSPL in light of the governments policy on local producers, two officials with knowledge of the discussions told Reuters. The ministry did not respond to a request for immediate comment.

" New Delhi : The 219th meeting of the Central Board of Employees' Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) held in New Delhi yesterday under the chairmanship of Union Minister of labour and Employment Shri Santosh Kumar Gangwar. Following where are the key decisions of the Board:- a) The Board took note of the 10 requests from ineligible establishments for waiver of damages during the period May 20, 2017 to September 30, 2017 which were earlier rejected by EPFO. b) The Central Board started investing in Equity Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) from August 2015. The Accounting Policy for valuation and accounting of equity investments were prepared in consultancy with IIM Bangalore. The observations of the CAG were also incorporated in the accounting policy. The same was approved by the Central Board. c) Present decentralized system of EPFO for making payment to its beneficiaries involves higher cost of transactions, delays in recredits in case of failed transaction and does not provide for AADHAAR enabled payments. Hence, EPFO proposed to move towards the Centralised Payment System using National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) platform. The benefits of the proposed system are:- Funds will be transferred on the same day to the beneficiaries through NPCI platform. Office may reconcile the transaction status on T+0 basis. This will result in early recredit in the accounts of beneficiaries in the case of failed transactions. Availability of the facility of AADHAAR enabled transfer of funds. Transaction cost by way of bank charges will also come down. The Board gave in-principle approval for the same. The Central Board also took note of the recent IT based initiatives of EPFO for better services to its stakeholders:- (1) Online Adhaar Verified UAN allotment to any citizen at Unifed Portal: Universal Account Number (UAN) is mandatory for filing the returns and depositing the contributions. However, the establishments face difficulties in seeding Aadhaar details of the employees. To obviate this difficulty, an open functionality has been introduced through which any citizen / present prospective employee can generate his/her UAN on the basis of Aadhaar and link his KYC details. The registration facility is available at Member Interface in the Unified Portal (https://unifiedportal-mem.epfindia.gov.in/memberinterface/). It being an online facility, there is no need to submit any physical documents. (2) Introduction of Online request functionality to EPF Subscribers for correction in Name, DoB and Gender: In line with the decision of Government for digital India, a functionality has been developed where member can give online request to his/her employer at Member Interface in the Unified Portal (https://unifiedportal-mem.epfindia.gov.in/memberinterface/) for correction in Name, DoB and Gender. EPFO is committed to strengthen the e-governance system to bring more transparency and to provide better services to its stakeholders. EPFO has already launched a number of e-governance initiatives such as Electronic Challan-cum-Return, Member e-passbook, payment through National Electronic Fund Transfer, Online Registration of Establishments, Mobile governance, Online receipt of claims, Auto transfer of Accounts etc. ","The Central Board also took note of the recent IT based initiatives of EPFO for better services to its stakeholders:- (1) Online Adhaar Verified UAN allotment to any citizen at Unifed Portal: Universal Account Number (UAN) is mandatory for filing the returns and depositing the contributions.

" CHICAGO/NEW YORK: U.S. stores offered deep discounts, entertainment and free gifts to draw bargain hunters on Black Friday, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season, but some shoppers said they were just eyeing goods, reserving their cash for online purchases. A sharp rise in online sales made the overall picture more positive for traditional retailers expanding beyond brick-and-mortar, sending their shares higher. Stores had also carefully managed inventory, hoping to ward off any post-holiday liquidation that would weigh on profits. There was little of the over-the-top frenzy that had been a hallmark of Black Friday in years past, and some stores appeared to be getting creative with gimmicks beyond heavy discounts. But signs pointing to muted in-store sales - fewer cars in mall parking lots, shoppers leaving with no purchases - do not portend a weak holiday season as U.S. consumers are expected to spend more overall, analysts and industry executives said. Black Friday sales were off to a strong start online, at $640 million of 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), according to Adobe Analytics, up 18.4 percent from a year ago. On Thanksgiving Day, U.S. shoppers spent more than $2.87 billion online. Some stores and websites struggle to keep up. Some sites experienced brief outages, including Lowe's, H&M and the Gap, according to website performance monitors. And Macy's Inc customers in states including Texas, Arizona and Illinois took to social media to complain about the retailer's credit card processing system. The company said payment processing was taking longer than usual in its stores and it was working to fix the problem. The hiccups dragged Macy's shares 0.6 lower in extended trading. They had ended the regular session up 2.1 percent, boosted by comments from Chief Executive Jeff Gennette, who told CNBC Macy's was better off this year than last, had robust online demand and was in a good place for holiday promotions. Adobe forecast online Black Friday sales of $5 billion, which would be a record high. Online retailers will rake in an additional $6.6 billion on Cyber Monday, Adobe said. Adobe measures 80 percent of online transactions at the largest 100 U.S. web retailers. Macy's and J.C. Penney Co Inc had ordered and managed inventory better this time, according to Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resources Group, a consultancy with seven researchers out in the field. ""The turnout this morning has been relatively slow but it is still the best we have seen in three years. We expect it to pick up as the day progresses,"" Flickinger said, citing improving consumer confidence, a strong job market and healthy housing prices. Some shoppers were lured by the promise of spectacle, while others felt the pull of nostalgia. ""It's like a hangout, it's an experience,"" said Jonathan Lin, 17. ""All my friends are back from college and we got together."" ""Theres something nostalgic about being at the stores this early, Jennifer Stasiak said at Chicagos popular Oakbrook Center. Miguel Flores, 43, an overnight security guard, visited a Target in Manhattan after his shift ended. ""I mostly shop online but decided to drop in because I havent been to a store in a long time,"" Flores said. J.C. Penney climbed 0.6 percent and Wal-Mart Stores Inc edged higher. Amazon.com Inc closed up 2.6 percent at a record high. Target Corp did not fare as well, with analysts noting that it closed its stores for several hours overnight while many rivals kept their doors open. Its shares fell 2.8 percent. NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE The period between the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and Christmas can make or a break a retailer, accounting for as much as 40 percent of annual revenue. More people picked up deals online and the traditional Black Friday rush was split by stores opening the night before. Godiva gave out free chocolates, while Sephora offered face masks and perfumes. Dancers entertained Bergdorf Goodman shoppers, according to the New York Post. The deepest Black Friday discounts included more than $200 off some Best Buy TVs, all bras across Victoria's Secret Pink stores for $25, half-price video games at Target, and $50 off PlayStation 4 Pro gaming consoles at Wal-Mart. In Pearland, Texas, a suburb of Houston, Derrell Felix, 56, had her eye on a Sharp 50-inch LED flat screen TV for $179, down from its original price of $499. I know they only have 20 of them in there so Im hoping they have some left by the time I get in, she said. There were some signs of the chaos for which Black Friday is traditionally known. A false report of gunfire caused shoppers to evacuate the Westland Mall in Hialeah, Florida. Stores reopened less than an hour later, Silvio Pera, a mall security supervisor told Reuters by phone. The Riverchase Galleria outside Birmingham, Alabama, said police broke up a fight on Thursday night between two women who might have been trying to get the same sale item in a store. The mall shut about 15 minutes early. A continued switch to online shopping, led by Amazon, has forced chains such as Toys R Us, apparel retailers True Religion, the Limited, Rue 21 and off-price retailer Payless Shoe Source to file for bankruptcy this year. Despite the explosive online growth, traditional retailers still earn the bulk of their revenue from in-store buys. Shoppers in brick-and-mortar stores can also be easier to tempt with impulse or add-on purchases than online browsers. THURSDAY NIGHT, CYBER MONDAY Amazon began touting its sales for Cyber Monday on Friday and said shoppers using its digital assistant Alexa could score deals on Sunday. Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's, J.C. Penney and others opened stores on Thursday evening and most have been offering extended deals online. Some started offering in-store deals earlier this week. Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, was crowded but not chaotic. Shoppers came for deals with nothing specific in mind. Many enjoyed the experience of trying on clothes rather than shopping online. A Macy's employee at the mall said it was less busy on Friday because the store had been open, and packed, on Thursday. ""Theyre all online,"" said Sarah Jones, 42, an employee at Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island. ""Ive worked in retail my whole life, trust me.""

" parties, whether it is held in Phnom Penh or Beijing, because such a meeting will certainly achieve no result,"" Sihanouk wrote in an Oct. 17 letter to his son, Prince Norodom Ranariddh, leader of the senior opposition FUNCINPEC party. A copy of the letter was obtained Thursday. In it, the king called on the three parties to make compromises to end the stalemate: ""Papa would like to ask all three parties to take responsibility before the nation and the people."" Hun Sen used Thursday's anniversary of a peace agreement ending the country's civil war to pressure the opposition to form a coalition government with his party. ""Only those who want to prolong the anarchy and instability prevent efforts to set up a new government,"" Hun Sen said in a televised speech marking the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Hun Sen's party won 64 of the 122 seats in parliament in July's national election, but not the two-thirds majority necessary to form a government on its own. Opposition parties led by Ranariddh and former finance minister Sam Ram Rainsy have refused to enter into a coalition with Hun Sen until their allegations of election fraud have been thoroughly investigated. International monitors said the election was relatively free and fair. Hun Sen said his current government would remain in power as long as the opposition refused to form a new one. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have remained outside the country since the Sept. 24 ceremonial convening of parliament. Citing Hun Sen's threats to arrest opposition politicians following two alleged attempts on his life, Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy have said they do not feel safe negotiating inside the country and asked the king to chair the summit at his residence in Beijing. Hun Sen has rejected the opposition's reservations, saying it would be inappropriate to hold a summit outside the country. Negotiations so far have proved fruitless except for the opening of parliament after a Sept. 22 summit led by the king. Hun Sen implied Thursday that the opposition failed to follow through on promises made at the summit. ""If those results are strictly respected, there seems no reason to hold another summit,"" Hun Sen said in a speech on the anniversary of the 1991 Paris Peace Accords. Sihanouk is reportedly set to fly to Beijing next month to receive medical treatment from his Chinese doctors. The 75-year-old monarch suffers from a variety ailments and periodically makes extended trips to Beijing. He was diagnosed with colon cancer in 1993, but it has since gone into remission. In September, thousands of people filled the streets of Phnom Penh to protest against the alleged election fraud. Hun Sen ordered police to break up the demonstrations. At least four demonstrators were killed by police, but the discovery of more than 20 bodies in the aftermath has prompted speculation that the death tally could be much higher.

"CHICAGO/NEW YORK: U.S. stores offered deep discounts, entertainment and free gifts to draw bargain hunters on Black Friday, the traditional start of the holiday shopping season, but some shoppers said they were just eyeing goods, reserving their cash for online purchases. A sharp rise in online sales made the overall picture more positive for traditional retailers expanding beyond brick-and-mortar, sending their shares higher. Stores had also carefully managed inventory, hoping to ward off any post-holiday liquidation that would weigh on profits. There was little of the over-the-top frenzy that had been a hallmark of Black Friday in years past, and some stores appeared to be getting creative with gimmicks beyond heavy discounts. But signs pointing to muted in-store sales - fewer cars in mall parking lots, shoppers leaving with no purchases - do not portend a weak holiday season as U.S. consumers are expected to spend more overall, analysts and industry executives said. Black Friday sales were off to a strong start online, at $640 million of 10 a.m. ET (1500 GMT), according to Adobe Analytics, up 18.4 percent from a year ago. On Thanksgiving Day, U.S. shoppers spent more than $2.87 billion online. Some stores and websites struggle to keep up. Some sites experienced brief outages, including Lowe's, H&M and the Gap, according to website performance monitors. And Macy's Inc customers in states including Texas, Arizona and Illinois took to social media to complain about the retailer's credit card processing system. The company said payment processing was taking longer than usual in its stores and it was working to fix the problem. The hiccups dragged Macy's shares 0.6 lower in extended trading. They had ended the regular session up 2.1 percent, boosted by comments from Chief Executive Jeff Gennette, who told CNBC Macy's was better off this year than last, had robust online demand and was in a good place for holiday promotions. Adobe forecast online Black Friday sales of $5 billion, which would be a record high. Online retailers will rake in an additional $6.6 billion on Cyber Monday, Adobe said. Adobe measures 80 percent of online transactions at the largest 100 U.S. web retailers. Macy's and J.C. Penney Co Inc had ordered and managed inventory better this time, according to Burt Flickinger, managing director of Strategic Resources Group, a consultancy with seven researchers out in the field. ""The turnout this morning has been relatively slow but it is still the best we have seen in three years. We expect it to pick up as the day progresses,"" Flickinger said, citing improving consumer confidence, a strong job market and healthy housing prices. Some shoppers were lured by the promise of spectacle, while others felt the pull of nostalgia. ""It's like a hangout, it's an experience,"" said Jonathan Lin, 17. ""All my friends are back from college and we got together."" ""Theres something nostalgic about being at the stores this early, Jennifer Stasiak said at Chicagos popular Oakbrook Center. Miguel Flores, 43, an overnight security guard, visited a Target in Manhattan after his shift ended. ""I mostly shop online but decided to drop in because I havent been to a store in a long time,"" Flores said. J.C. Penney climbed 0.6 percent and Wal-Mart Stores Inc edged higher. Amazon.com Inc closed up 2.6 percent at a record high. Target Corp did not fare as well, with analysts noting that it closed its stores for several hours overnight while many rivals kept their doors open. Its shares fell 2.8 percent. NOT WHAT IT USED TO BE The period between the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday and Christmas can make or a break a retailer, accounting for as much as 40 percent of annual revenue. More people picked up deals online and the traditional Black Friday rush was split by stores opening the night before. Godiva gave out free chocolates, while Sephora offered face masks and perfumes. Dancers entertained Bergdorf Goodman shoppers, according to the New York Post. The deepest Black Friday discounts included more than $200 off some Best Buy TVs, all bras across Victoria's Secret Pink stores for $25, half-price video games at Target, and $50 off PlayStation 4 Pro gaming consoles at Wal-Mart. In Pearland, Texas, a suburb of Houston, Derrell Felix, 56, had her eye on a Sharp 50-inch LED flat screen TV for $179, down from its original price of $499. I know they only have 20 of them in there so Im hoping they have some left by the time I get in, she said. There were some signs of the chaos for which Black Friday is traditionally known. A false report of gunfire caused shoppers to evacuate the Westland Mall in Hialeah, Florida. Stores reopened less than an hour later, Silvio Pera, a mall security supervisor told Reuters by phone. The Riverchase Galleria outside Birmingham, Alabama, said police broke up a fight on Thursday night between two women who might have been trying to get the same sale item in a store. The mall shut about 15 minutes early. A continued switch to online shopping, led by Amazon, has forced chains such as Toys R Us, apparel retailers True Religion, the Limited, Rue 21 and off-price retailer Payless Shoe Source to file for bankruptcy this year. Despite the explosive online growth, traditional retailers still earn the bulk of their revenue from in-store buys. Shoppers in brick-and-mortar stores can also be easier to tempt with impulse or add-on purchases than online browsers. THURSDAY NIGHT, CYBER MONDAY Amazon began touting its sales for Cyber Monday on Friday and said shoppers using its digital assistant Alexa could score deals on Sunday. Wal-Mart, Target, Macy's, J.C. Penney and others opened stores on Thursday evening and most have been offering extended deals online. Some started offering in-store deals earlier this week. Garden State Plaza in Paramus, New Jersey, was crowded but not chaotic. Shoppers came for deals with nothing specific in mind. Many enjoyed the experience of trying on clothes rather than shopping online. A Macy's employee at the mall said it was less busy on Friday because the store had been open, and packed, on Thursday. ""Theyre all online,"" said Sarah Jones, 42, an employee at Roosevelt Field Mall on Long Island. ""Ive worked in retail my whole life, trust me.""","A Macy's employee at the mall said it was less busy on Friday because the store had been open, and packed, on Thursday.

"CHENNAI/HYDERABAD: Police on Monday arrested a Tamil Nadu-cadre trainee IPS officer after Intelligence Bureau officers caught him cheating in the Union Public Service Commission (Main) Examination at a test centre in Egmore, Chennai. Investigators said Safeer Karim, an assistant superintendent of police in Nanguneri, Tirunelveli, took a cellphone, a Bluetooth-enabled miniature camera in a shirt button and wireless earpieces into the examination hall in Presidency Girls Higher Secondary School. ""Karim's wife, Joicy Joy, dictated the answers to him from Hyderabad,"" an investigating officer said. The Hyderabad police made coordinated arrests, taking Joy into custody at `La Excellence IAS -The Institute for Civil Services' at Ashok Nagar Crossroads in Hyderabad, where she was a visiting faculty member, as well as the institute's director and Karim's friend, P Rambabu. ""Karim wanted to join the IAS, so he took the UPSC exams again,"" the officer said. Karim, from Aluva, Kerala, who ranked 112 in a second attempt at the UPSC exams in 2015 after falling short in the interview the previous year, is an electronics engineer and proprietor of Karim's IAS, which trains civil service candidates and has branches in Kochi and Thiruvananthapuram. The officer said the IB, suspecting that Karim had cheated in the first of five tests in the UPSC examinations on Saturday, had put him under surveillance. They also monitored his wife. Four IB sleuths followed him to the examination hall on Monday where Karim successfully tricked a couple of policemen who were frisking candidates at the entry. ""Karim handed over his wallet and a cellphone to them from his trouser pockets, apologizing for forgetting to leave the handset in his car,"" the officer said. ""But he had concealed another phone and wireless earpieces in his socks and a miniature camera in his shirt."" The three-hour examination started at 9am. Twenty minutes later, IB sleuths entered the hall, searched Karim and seized the cellphone, which had concealed under his seat, the camera and earpieces. Police on Tuesday night produced Karim before a magistrate, who remanded him in judicial custody. Officers said he faces dismissal from the IPS because he is still on probation. Friends told investigators that after Karim met with an accident recently and failed police fitness tests, he believed he did not have a viable future unless he opted for the IAS, the officer said. They told officers that Karim had been a topper in the CAT business school entrance exam, but in 2015 set up institutes in Kerala to train students for the civil service exams. Kareem met Joy when she took a job as an economics teacher at his academy and married her in 2016.
